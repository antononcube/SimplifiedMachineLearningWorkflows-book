"2016.Abraham.Gadalla.Save.your.time.and.your","Abraham Gadalla","Save your time and your students time by using Mathematica for learning and teaching.","This presentation demonstrates samples of Algebra, Geometry, precalculus, and Calculus that I used with my students and made them love and enjoy math so much that some of them decided to be math teachers and professors in mathematics at different universities including Berlin (Germany). With Mathematica you can have the love, the excitements, the enthusiasm, and the exploration of the mathematical concepts as well as their applications while saving you time. In short, Mathematica is the way it should be for teaching and learning. Keep the dynamic interaction instead of the boring slides with Power Point, or any other software.","Education"
"2016.George.Danner.Talking.to.Models","George Danner","Talking to Models","What if we could interact with our Wolfram Language-based applications verbally? What if we could say, for example, ""Give me the Fibonacci Number 10"", rather than type Fibonacci[10] into Mathematica. What if we could call on any arbitrarily complex function written in the Wolfram Language? The Amazon Echo was released in early 2016 as a remarkable consumer device. Its audible natural language processing capabilities are excellent, answering a wide range of verbal questions and commands in Siri-like fashion. However, the even more remarkable aspect of Amazon Echo is its open architecture\[LongDash]allowing custom applications to be bolted onto the cloud-based Alexa Voice Service\[LongDash]including Wolfram Language code! In our talk we will demonstrate the connection between the Amazon Echo and an example Wolfram Language code fragment, and describe the integration process we followed.","Software Development"

For the first time, we are generating the exams using an application built with Wolfram Language. The automation process require a database of questions with dynamic values written in Mathematica notebooks. These questions are then consumed by a build process to fit into an exam template. This talk will showcase the automation process and some generated exams.","Education"
"2016.Enrique.Vílchez.Quesada.Vil.Cretas..package.educational","Enrique Vílchez Quesada","Vil Cretas ? package: educational resource through the use of Mathematica software in the field of discrete mathematics","The work focuses on showing the overall operation of a package designed by the author, oriented known commercial software Mathematica, intended to serve as educational support to develop each of the main themes of the course ""EIF-203 Discrete Structures for Computer "". The proposal is to be innovative in the absence of a computational tool for educational purposes, which holistically allow addressing content areas: recursion, recurrence relations, analysis of algorithms, relations, graph theory, theory of trees, machines and finite state automata and languages and grammars. At present most of the educational software in this field that is available in the market and academia, focuses only on purely graphic themes. The Vil Cretas ? package is conceived as a latent need in the chair of the course IFT-203 and similar courses at many universities both nationally and internationally, where discrete mathematics has become an obstacle to the student population. Vil Creta ? s aims in this direction, become a source of support to transform arid issues in conceptual visualization possibilities and autonomous construction.","Education"
"2016.Hee.Joong.Yun.Vectorial.Platform.for.Manipulating.Polarization","Hee-Joong Yun","Vectorial Platform for Manipulating Polarization Mode Train Realized with Jones Vectors in Mathematica","Fundamental concept in physics of polarization propagation of electromagnetic waves is newly understood to be a cardinal keyword in quantum cryptography transport technology and cosmology. Interactive visualization of the propagation mechanism of polarized electromagnetism in a medium with its helicity has received attention recently from scientists in the age of information and communication. > Here, we present a new dynamic polarization platform jdpmp4t with four lined up optical elements for more effective manipulation of polarization modes simulation with Jones vector in Mathematica. The platform simulates the polarization process of the Overscript[E, \[RightVector]] vector field together with that of the Overscript[B, \[RightVector]] vector field by using the Arrow function of Mathematica so that the platform might animate a transverse EM wave satisfying Maxwell' s wave equations every point on the advancing axes of the platform. Consequently, the vectors Overscript[E, \[RightVector]], Overscript[B, \[RightVector]], and Overscript[S, \[RightVector]] form a right - hand orthogonal set of field vectors. The platform can be manipulated one of four train modes interactively to advance the polarized mode while the user select one of modes at panel of platform. In addition, we shall demonstrate other vectorial Mathematica platforms such as EM field propagations, C oriolis force and whiskbroom pattern in Minkowski space.","Science, Engineering"

It is known that TPA having just three oscillation phases is realized by impulsive forcing. One of the important characteristics of TPA as a logical element is the oscillation build-up speed. It is obtained by solving the differential equation describing the system. Mathematica is used to solve the equation by averaging method for both the binary and ternary parametrons.","Science, Engineering"
"2016.Joseph.Haley.Using.Directional.Bit.Sequences.to","Joseph Haley","Using Directional Bit Sequences to Reveal the Property-Liability Underwriting Cycle as an Algorithmic Process","This study presents a computational economics simulation of the property-liability insurance industry underwriting cycle. The simulation is built on downward-sloping demand, a simplistic version of the capacity constraint model, and a simple pricing rule. The pricing rule has each simulated insurer determine its price from the expected losses per-policy (a constant), the previous year’s policyholders’ surplus and the previous year’s number of customers. Through the use of directional bit sequences a common structure is revealed between the aggregate simulation results and the actual aggregate underwriting margin, 1930-2000. The common structure between these aggregate variables is evidence the property-liability underwriting cycle, in a consistent effort to reach equilibrium, follows an algorithmic process. Of further inference; the pursuit of equilibrium, as an attractor, is the only consistent characteristic of the algorithmically generated process. The times series b ehavior of the simulated underwriting margin, as it fluctuates around the equilibrium attractor, can assume a variety of shapes across many realizations of the algorithmic process. Finally, behavior of the simulated individual companies is not, for the most part, correlated with the aggregate behavior, and virtually all individual transactions are out-of-equilibrium transactions in the sense that they occur along the demand curve.","Data Analytics & Information Science"
"2016.Aneet.Dharmavaram.Narendranath.Dynamics.of.Thin.Liquid.Films","Aneet Dharmavaram Narendranath","Dynamics of Thin Liquid Films in Zero Gravity: Stabilization and Destabilization","Predicting dynamics of liquid films in zero gravity has significant applications for both space travel and terrestrial applications where gravity does not play an important role in comparison with other effects such as surface tension and thermocapillarity (changes in surface tension due to temperature gradients). A fourth order non-linear partial differential equation (Evolution equation) from the lubrication approximation in fluid dynamics, is applied to study the dynamics of liquid films in zero gravity, under the effect of an interplay between various stabilizing and destabilizing mechanisms. Previously, while using NDSolve to validate a custom high-resolution solver we discovered that the generic Mathematica PDE algorithms were sufficiently accurate and flexible to provide useful results for the challenging problem of tracking singularity formation which indicates rupture. We continue the usage of NDSolve to further this study. We shift our focus to thermocapillary f inger formation and their stabilization instead of rigorously studying rupture.","Science/Engineering"

"2016.Alan.Calvitti.Working.with.Temporal.Data.Healthcare","Alan Calvitti","Working with Temporal Data: Healthcare Applications","Mathematica version 10 introduced a range of innovative features for data, including Association which enables nested key-value arrays and arbitrary structured keys (compare to JSON). These features can be used to index temporal data as a flexible alternative to the built-in Time Series ? representation. We show how to index, prep, merge, perform temporal logic and graphics using real-world examples in healthcare to showcase the extreme efficiency of building scientific workflows in Mathematica using functional query patterns. (1) On the scientific side, we describe NIH/AHRQ funded time-motion study of activity collected during medical office visits at two large clinics. We're interested in how doctors use computers and how they use time while with patients (gaze to computer). Analysis steps include synchronization of various sensors to the visit timeline, organizing statistics at multiple levels of aggregation (hierarchical analysis) and visualizing the resulting patterns such as navigation across screens (sequential analysis). (2) On the tech R&D side, we describe a prototype Clinical Event Browser (CEB), a single-timeline chronological view of patient data, part of a national VA initiative (Vista Evolution) to develop next generation, web-based user interfaces to align with clinicians' needs to access data, improve decision making and care coordination. CEB leverages underlying timestamped logs and blend various data types including numerical (eg vital signs, lab results), events (eg visits, clinical reminders) and semi-structured fields like text and other codes, as well as highlight trends in patient's condition.","Data Analytics & Information Science"

Book will be ‘published’ using Wolfram Mathematica to create a dynamic, variable, interactive learning environment for students Olympic College is a part of an initial deployment of Wolfram Mathematica by Computational Class Notes ? . My colleagues and I see the power of the technology specifically when deployment is on the cloud. We have seen the response from our students through • More effective learning – moving through the material more quickly • Enhanced retention of complex subject matter • Reduction in cost to students who no longer needed to buy books or calculators because everything that they need is in one space (most have mobile devices, phones, etc. and using the cloud they could access the material) • We provide laptops for those who need that support • Improved grades • Renewed or totally increased confidence • Very few students need to repeat the course • My colleagues and I identified that we are guiding our students to build a foundation for success This experience prompted me to look at the amount of material that I have learned through my teaching and I will now harness the material to provide a high quality service and product to students at Olympic College. Result will be that students – not only in my classes but in the college – can access sections/chapters of my book through a student portal at very reasonable cost to them.","Education"
"2016.Dara.Shayda.Mathematica.Based.Prosthetics..Orthotics","Dara Shayda","Mathematica Based Prosthetics & Orthotics","Based upon Mathematica's new Region functions and symbolic graphics and advanced differential equation solvers on arbitrary regions and version 11's advanced 3D printing functions, we are glad to announce the new Open Source non-profit R&D for developing advanced and economic prosthetics and orthotics suitable for use in most medical establishments. Our aim is to use Mathematica based system below to 3D scan and print $50 fixed limb socket for US and international consumption, with 100% open source code and systems to allow researchers and medical practitioners to cooperate to build a community and market place. Mathematica's Cloud and CDF technologies provide us with the following advantages unparalleled by any other software network system: 1. Whether in Cloud or CDF or a notebook the computational geometric operations are treated as a part of the language and therefore we are able to develop an order of magnitude less code with much higher functionality e.g. in comparison to a traditional solid modelling software 2. Mobile Cloud computing allows for Third World and Displaced People medical treatment; it is only a matter of 2-3 years prior to advent of smart phone 3D scanners and retail priced mobile MRI hand-held equipment. 3. System Modeler is proposed to be used for ""joint"" development e.g. knee or elbow or finger joints. There are many who attempt to use 3D scanners and 3D printers to develop prosthetics but they lack the ability to simulate and debug and design complex joint systems. 4. FEM (Finite Element Method package) used for proximity analysis and pressure mapping of the flesh/bone against the 3D printed socket. Already 64 CPU core hardware + licenses for Mathematica with Enterprise CDF for each CPU core in place. 5. Communication between the 3D printed structures and joints with the Wolfram Cloud to allow for the doctor to track the inner-working of 3D structure in touch with flesh and bones. This will be accomplished by an add on sensor attached to the Prosthetics e.g. Raspberry PI or Beaglebone embedded systems. 6.

"2016.Stan.Wagon.The.Ultimate.Tetratorus","Stan Wagon","The Ultimate Tetratorus","In 1958 Swierczkowski showed that there is no chain of congruent regular tetrahedra T(1), T(2), ...,T(n) that meet face to face, do not intersect except at the junction faces, and close up (i.e., T(n) and T(1) share a face). Such rings do exist for the other four regular solids. In 2014, we showed that there is such a chain so that there is a small gap -- 10^-18 -- between a face of T(n) and a face of T(1) . The natural conjecture is that there are such chains with gap error below any preassigned positive epsilon. We have found a structure that yields gap errors below 10^-200, and it is likely that these patterns will yield a proof of the conjecture.","Math"
"2016.Kyle.Keane.Code.Seal...A","Kyle Keane","Code Seal ? : A System for Teaching the Art of Scientific Narratives","Built on top of Mathematica, we have developed an open publication and distribution platform for interactive STEM curriculum (learning modules) that use the Wolfram Language. Modules published using our platform present STEM concepts while requiring students to complete computational programming challenges that reinforce the application of those concepts. We support the interactive power of Dynamic[] constructs, such as Manipulate[], and the algorithmic power of the Wolfram Language. Published modules can be used in traditional classrooms and for synchronous or self-paced online education. Currently, the system is being used in multiple universities across the United States, and we are looking for teachers to join our movement. In this talk, we will provide an overview of our platform, provide a live walk-through of a learning module, describe the (very simple) authoring process, and provide instruction for new authors looking to publish learning modules with us. By completing a module, students build their own personalized electronic document full of rich interactive visualizations and effective coding techniques. This flexible document combines the information of a traditional textbook with a personal collection of code that can be continually expanded well after graduation. The goal is to inspire students to make their own education rather than simply consuming it.","Education"

"2016.David.Quesada.From.Statistical.Analysis.to.Mathematical","David Quesada","From Statistical Analysis to Mathematical System Modeling: Respiratory Health in South Florida","Health data collected by the Department of Health of Florida from January 2005 to December 2012 are analyzed in conjunction with weather information gathered from NWS and Weatherbug stations across South Florida. Data processing is performed using Mathematica 10.4 capabilities and rendered in variety of formats that are easy to be understood by medical practioners. Such an analysis is aimed at finding potential correlations between weather conditions and the number of cases of asthma and other respiratory disorders at Emergency Departments in Miami Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. From the above biometeorological analysis, a system based approach is adopted in developing two mathematical models capable to describe the above obtained correlations. One of the models includes the interaction between the immune, endocrine, and nervous systems and able to describe the triggering of asthma.The second model explores the potential relation between epidemics, seasonality, and the triggering of respiratory disorders.","Data Analytics & Information Science"
"2016.David.Quesada.From.Time.Series.to.Brain","David Quesada","From Time Series to Brain Networks: Analysis of Brain Network Dynamics in Case of Epilepsy.","Mapping brain areas responsible for pathological behaviors of the central nervous system is one of the areas of major interest in transalational medicine nowadays. In this sense, the concept of brain networks ha emerged as one of the most fascinating applications of graph theory and complex networks. This communication is aimed at presenting the application of above ideas to address epilepsy. By using the capabilities provided by Matematica 10.4 to deal with networks and time series analysis, data obtained from EEG measurements are anlyzed and mapped into a network. Variabilities within obtained network - measurement batches are computed and some predictions are advanced in terms of network features. Additionally, two types of mathematical models are solved, the Fizt Hugh ? - Nagumo and the Kuramoto model opearting on a network. The former accounts for the behavior of a group of neurons within a particular cortical region of the brain, while the secon is used to account for the synchronicity between different areas within the Temporal Lobes, where epileptic focal points use to be localized. Results from this research are transalated into methologies to be followed by surgeons when they do surgical procedures in patients who do not respond to antiepileptic medications.","Engineering/Science"
"2016.Rodrigo.Obando.Probabilistic.Cellular.Automata.from.cluster","Rodrigo Obando","Probabilistic Cellular Automata from cluster signatures","Cellular Automata has been used to study complex systems. Cellular Automata rule spaces are the sets that contain the rules for given properties such as number of cell states, dimensionality and evaluation radius. Obando introduced a way of partitioning the rule spaces by defining primitves for the rules. The number of primitives is defined by the number of cell states. If we use these primitives to order the rule spaces, we find that each primitive define a rule space dimension (not to be confused with the dimensionality of the rules.) These dimensions are partially ordered and not easily visualized. Huffman introduced a way of clustering rules according to their behavior but defined also by the closeness in this space. The clusters can be characterized by cluster signatures. Among interesting facts in the Elementary Cellular Automata, a particular cluster signature contains the rules (18,26,82,90,146,154,210,218) which all evolve Sierpinski triangles under an input of a sin gle black cell. The cluster signatures can be complemented and the complement cluster signature for the cluster mentioned contains the rules (183,181,167,182,166,180,165,164) which evolves also into Sierpinski triangles except under an input of a single white cell. These clusters are {{""N"",""P"",""P"",""N""},{""D"",""D"",""D"",""P""}} and {{""P"",""D"",""D"",""D""},{""N"",""P"",""P"",""N""}} respectively. We define a probabilistic cellular automata based on these cluster signatures and an important characteristics exhibited by these automata is structural stability in their global behavior.","Engineering/Science"
"2016.Zbigniew.Kabala.Well.Hydraulics.with.Mathematica","Zbigniew Kabala","Well Hydraulics with Mathematica","Well hydraulics, a subfield of groundwater hydrology and reservoir engineering, focuses on developing and applying mathematical models relating the pressure drop in geologic formations to the pumping rate from a well. Based on pumping tests, such models are used to assess whether or not a given formation could be economically exploited for water, oil, or gas. Such models are also used in designing remediation of contaminated formations, especially aquifers that provide 25%-50% of our drinking water. With the exception of geometrically simple formations and wells, for which analytic solutions exist, most of the models needed in practice are represented by semi-analytic solutions in the Laplace domain that require numerical inversion. Written in C++ or Fortran, most codes in the field employ the Stehfest (1970) algorithm that approximates the numerical inversion of a Laplace transform by a linear combination of n transform evaluations. Theoretically, the Stehfest approximation converges with n -> \[Infinity]. However, its weights grow with n, and they should not exceed 12 in double-precision used by the commercial or public-domain codes. With its arbitrary precision capabilities, Mathematica comes to the rescue. We will discuss the limitations of the existing codes widely used in well hydraulics for modeling wells situated in open (unpressurized) formations such as water-table aquifers. We will show how these limitations are elegantly overcome in Mathematica.","Engineering/Science"
"2016.Pedro.Fonseca.Prototyping.Interface.Tools.for.Volumetric","Pedro Fonseca","Prototyping Interface Tools for Volumetric Data Exploration in VR Environments","3D virtual reality has recently become extremely accessible. Many applications already exist for this technology, and many others are constantly being developed. Typical virtual environments place the explorer in a 3D virtual world populated with 2D geometries: surfaces, lines, etc. But many science and engineering fields generate 3D volumetric data (computational fluid dynamics, RMI, ct-scans, etc.). Such volumetric / ""dense"" information can easily be pre-processed into 2D geometries (slices, iso-surfaces, streamlines, etc.). Most of these information extraction techniques were created to explore 3D data in 2D environments (screens, printed paper, etc.). With VR tools being generalized, we can nowadays easily enter inside 3D data fields. But should we keep using the tools adapted for a 2D world? Or can we explore these information fields in a more immersed way? In this presentation we will discuss a small set of visualization and navigation tools, prototyped with the WL, specifically imagined to explore volumetric data. Equipped with invisibility hand-held spotlights and laser beam pointers, we will navigate through information fields, with the help of films, recorded from the point of view of the explorer.","Visualization/Image Processing"
"2016.Thorsten.Förstemann.The.area.oft.the.Mandelbrot","Thorsten Förstemann","The area oft the Mandelbrot set – yet another two numerical approaches","An analytical expression of the area of the Mandelbrot set is unknown. So far, the most accurate numerical estimation of the area by R.P. Munfao (2012) has a precision of 7 decimals and takes 8 days on a standard quad core PC. Gaining one more digit would take about 10^2 = 100x the CPU load or about 800 days, theoretically. Practically, in a first approach (2012) 8 digits of precision were reached with about 50x the CPU load. Mathematica with Open CL ? on a $1000 PC system provides approximately a 12x speedup, resulting in a decent CPU time of about 35 days. A drawback of the first approach is that the numerical error is based on statistics and has limited theoretical significance. With the second approach (2016) precise upper and lower bounds of the area can be calculated on the same PC system. So far, the most accurate numerical estimation of the precise lower and upper bounds by Fisher/Hill (2001) on 100 standard single core PCs is based on a quad tree tessellation of depth 1 9. This second approach reaches a tessellation of depth 24 using Mathematica and Open CL ? , thus about 2^(2x5) = 1024x the CPU load. Depths of 25 or 26 are in reach, resulting in quad trees in the range of Terabytes of compressed data – the next bottleneck…","Math"

During the past year we have been working on the first phase of the project, using various functionalities of the Wolfram technology stack to model and prototype. The presentation will review three projects: 1. Modeling Historical Data MDG and World Bank ? data into semantic data. Historical data as raw material for modeling SDG data forms. The goal is to show on historical data / historical models how the current capabilities of the Wolfram Stack might be utilized with emphasis on the new Entity Store ? [ ] functionality. 2.

"2016.Jakub.Kabala.Computational.Approaches.to.Authorship.Attribution","Jakub Kabala","Computational Approaches to Authorship Attribution in a Corpus of 12th-century Latin Texts","This presentation applies techniques of hierarchical distance clustering and machine learning to a famous and vexing problem of authorship attribution in medieval history. Sometime before 1110, an anonymous author working in Venice, known as the Monk of Lido, wrote in Latin a contentious account of the First Crusade (1096-1101). Around 1113, another anonymous author working in Poland, known as the Gallus Anonymous, composed in Latin the earliest account of Polish history. For decades, historians and philologists have argued whether or not Monk and Gallus are in fact one and the same anonymous author. I have used Mathematica to answer this question using hierarchical distance clustering and machine learning. First, I build a large corpus of representative Latin texts from the 11th and 12th centuries. Second, I convert each member text into a vector containing the frequencies of the 250 most frequently occurring words (MFW) in the entire corpus. Third, I use the eight distance measures in Mathematica's Hierarchical Clustering ? package to calculate the distances between Gallus and Monk's frequency vectors, and to situate their proximity in the context of the entire corpus. Finally, I use machine learning algorithms to train a series of classifiers that can predict a text's authorship based on its MFW frequencies. Cross-validation indicates that Gallus and Monk are very likely one and the same author. The results also reveal the especially high and hitherto underexplored effectiveness of the Bray Curtis Distance measure and of logistic regression in shedding light on questions of authorship attribution.","Data Analytics & Information Science"
"2016.Gunnar.Preiß.Networking.of.Fuel.Cell.Stacks","Gunnar Preiß","Networking of Fuel Cell Stacks using the Wolfram Modeling and Simulation Suite","An integration of several fuel cell stacks into a single fuel cell system, a so-called fuel cell network, features a variety of possible network topologies for the corresponding fuel cells. Such topological configurations are well-known for the electrical and thermal architectures of electrochemical energy storage devices like secondary batteries or supercapacitors. It is a novel approach, however, to incorporate the reactant supply architectures of electrochemical energy conversion devices like fuel cells or redox-flow batteries while investigating their network topologies. Using Wolfram System Modeler ? , basic modules of fuel cell networks are developed in the Modelica language for drag-and-drop modeling of all possible fuel cell network topologies. This enables multiphysics simulation of the dynamical behavior of fuel cell networks. With the help of Wolfram Mathematica, fuel cell network models are analyzed and optimized, particularly with regard to model-based design of control systems. It is shown that fuel cell networks offer a higher overall system efficiency, compared to conventional fuel cell system possessing a single fuel cell stack. Furthermore, it is illustrated that fuel cell network systems demonstrate an increased operating range and less dynamical transients. Fuel cells offer considerable benefits in sustainable energy conversion, but have not been widely developed for commercial applications, so far. Fuel cell networks could provide improvements in performance, longevity, reliability, and cost over conventional fuel cell systems.","Engineering/Science"

"2016.Andrew.Yule.Lessons.Learned.From.Application.Development","Andrew Yule","Lessons Learned From Application Development with the Wolfram Language","Alex, nicknamed after the library of Alexandria, is the combined effort of Assured Flow Solutions to create an all-encompassing set of tools for handling its vast array of internal calculations, workflows and data analysis techniques. Assured Flow Solutions is a specialty engineering company focusing on oil and gas “flow assurance”, which attempts to assure optimal production and flow of hydrocarbons from reservoir to surface. The majority of its work involves studies to address certain production scenarios and the challenges associated with them. Assured Flow Solutions relies on a vast set of tools to solve these problems, which includes both academic and industry knowledge, as well as computer aided simulations. A large portion of these calculations and workflows are captured in small utilities, one-off reports, and poorly manage spreadsheet macros. Grouping these tools together and leveraging the power of the Wolfram Language has allowed Assured Flow Solutions to create a truly unique set of tools not seen in the industry to date. This presentation will discuss the Wolfram Language’s vital role in the successful (and timely) development of Alex. Specifically, it will address two different areas: 1. The role Wolfram Language can play in the oil and gas industry 2. Lessons learned in application development with the Wolfram Language","Engineering/Science"

Just as a media sample will appear the same if repeated unless altered (such as by an artist), so too will mathematical relations such as those found in number theory appear the same to all observers unless acted upon by artistic sensibilities. Similarly, physical simulation set with the exact same ideal conditions and rule sets should evolve in the same predictable manners by recurring laws unless altered (artistically). Computational Jockey (CJ) is the updating of traditional Disc Jockey (DJ) and (VJ) Video Jockey arts into the world of abstract mathematics and visualization.

For example, the pioneering data equivalence philosophy of Stephan Wolfram, the mathematical cataloging of Eric Weisstein, and the pioneering 3D visual graphic design of Tom Wickham-Jones are all major influences to this system. In addition to concept art and technical demos, Scantron will perform some mathematics-based art and music in order to display key points of the CJ system and philosophy. He will also discuss how current mathematical investigations such as the Langlands Correspondence, polytopes, and p-adic number relations may have much to say and share with modern mathematical art.","Data Analytics & Information Science"

The differences between the two cultures can be observed by comparing 1) what is considered important while participating in them, and 2) the methodologies employed for solving ""real life"", practical problems. Obviously, the cultural differences stem from practitioners backgrounds and schooling and we are going to point major differences of educational and experience backgrounds. (Also, jobs.) General observations will be stated and an overview of concrete examples (in Mathematica) is going to be presented. The concrete examples are from the (sufields of data analysis, prediction, recommendations, time series, gambling mathematics. Two examples are going to be discussed in more detail: 1) using collaborative filtering instead of regression, and 2) using natural language processing techniques in time series prediction.

My presentation will discuss my journey as I learned the Wolfram Language using Dr. Stephen Wolfram's book ""An Elementary Introduction to the Wolfram Language"", how the Wolfram Language can be greatly leveraged in projects such as mine, and the next steps I plan to take. My presentation will share how my learning experience was different for the Wolfram Language as opposed to the previous ones I have learned, such as Java and Swift, the challenges I faced as I learned computational thinking for the very first time using the Wolfram Language and how I overcame them, but more importantly, how I discovered the broad range of possibilities the language has to offer, unlike any other. The Wolfram Mentorship Program has also been a cornerstone to my learning. My presentation will discuss how the structure of the Wolfram Mentorship Program has helped me through the process, and what I found critical to my learning the language.

"2016.Ferhan.Atici..Mustafa.Atici.A.New.Algorithm.for.Data","Ferhan Atici & Mustafa Atici","A New Algorithm for Data Fitting","Up to date, there have been many methods developed to estimate the parameters for nonlinear curve fitting or nonlinear least square fitting.Some of these include method of partial sums, Hotelling' s method, method of successive approximations, and method of moments.The Marquardt -\[Dash]Levenberg algorithm is most widely used method in nonlinear least squares fitting.On the other hand, parameter estimations in nonlinear differential equation models can be done by solving the nonlinear differential equation with numerical approximations and then applying one of the above method for parameter estimations to the solution for least squares fitting.The models the mathematicians develop are unlikely to have analytical solutions in the early stage of their research.The numerical methods need to be applied to solve them. In this work, we develop a parameter estimation algorithm in Mathematica. This algorithm can be used as a least square fitting method for both solutions (i.e.curves) and differential (fractional differential, difference, fractional difference, etc.) equation models.Hence if one wants to use this algorithm, he/she does not need to solve the nonlinear model for data fitting.There are two reasons behind exploring a new algorithm for data fitting: First, we want to keep the model as it be for fitting, i.e.to avoid using solutions obtained by approximation techniques. Second, we want to keep the number of parameters as small as possible. If we solve the models, one more parameter will be added to the set of parameters.","Engineering/Science"

Typically, work is supported in large part by monolithic institutional systems that require users to be trained in basic use, and to wait too long for modifications necessary for them to work more efficiently and effectively. While these systems are a great way to store and secure data, they are not as helpful in application of data resources. This begs the question: what performance benefits might accrue through relaxing these constraints? What if users had the first word in design of their own “information appliances”? We show how Mathematica is used to rapidly build, test and productionize user-designed computational artifacts, information appliances, that support individual and group tasks in a variety of research workflows. Collectively these appliances “scaffold” the workflow, allowing users within to target precisely the methods and data they require, as well as customize computational products to fit their specific individual needs. We have increased productivity 60% using these methods; additionally, Mathematica allows us to build these tools rapidly (10 to 100 times faster than our traditional IT methods.) By thereby accelerating the rate at which the computational scaffold is “tuned” to work requirements, we proportionately accelerate the rate of organizational innovation and overall institutional sustainability. Our talk details these accomplishments, and the particular applications of Mathematica critical to the large financial return to these methods.","Cloud and Software Development"

"2016.Alexander.Radkevich.Retrieving.Bi.Directional.Reflectance.Distribution.Function","Alexander Radkevich","Retrieving Bi-Directional Reflectance Distribution Function from Surface Reflected Radiance using Decoupling of Atmospheric Radiative Transfer and Surface Reflection","The bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) defines anisotropy of the reflective properties of a surface. It is required to specify a boundary condition for radiative transfer (RT) modeling which is used in various applications such as aerosol retrievals, cloud retrievals, and atmospheric modeling. Ground based measurements of reflected radiance draw increasing attention as a source of information about anisotropy of surface reflection. However, experimental data need to be corrected for atmospheric effects to derive surface BRDF. This study develops a new method of retrieving BRDF on its whole domain making it immediately suitable for further atmospheric RT modeling applications. The method is based on decoupling of atmospheric RT and surface reflection (Radkevich 2013, JQSRT). It was shown that surface reflected radiance satisfies an integral equation which kernel and source depend on BRDF (provided it is known) and solutions of atmosphere-only RT problems. If surface reflected radiance is known that equation can be solved with respect to unknown BRDF. In particular, the equation has the form suitable for successive iterations. In this study successive iterations approach with under-relaxation was implemented along with Nyström method. The key feature of the method is that RT modeling has to be done only one time before the start of iterative process. This modeling was performed with DISORT. This differs the method from previously developed methods (Martonchik 1994, Remote Sens. Environ.; Lyapustin and Privette 1998, JGR) that require RT modeling on every iteration.

The following two centuries saw successive attempts to reduce or eliminate astigmatism, optically and surgically, with an ever-converging trend reminiscent of Zeno’s paradox. The reduction of astigmatism at the time of modern day cataract surgery is usually achieved through one of two techniques: Through the implantation of a toric intraocular lens or through incisions in the limbus or cornea, with each technique leaving a degree of residual astigmatism. Recently the femtosecond laser has allowed for corneal incisions to be more accurately placed and nomograms for the corresponding astigmatism reduction are constantly being refined. We developed a method and technique to achieve zero astigmatism by combining contributions from an astigmatism correction “basis” allowing better surgical results through simpler and safer approaches. We illustrate the central role of Mathematica in the development and implementation of these techniques.

"2016.Ben.Koo.Delivering.Computational.Thinking.to.the","Ben Koo","Delivering Computational Thinking to the mass using Extreme Learning Process with Mathematica","A new course, Systems Design in Computational Thinking, is being taught at Tsinghua University as an educational experiment to integrate design thinking with computational rigor. The goal is to guide novice students who have no computer science background to gain familiarity with the full stack of computational abstractions so that they can use different kinds of abstractions to analyze daily system design problems. To ensure students' mental models match the rigor of different computational abstractions, we have students use an existing system of simulation tools to create a fully functional computing system from scratch. This includes using a hardware description language to compose logic gates, ALU, memory and CPU, and “hack” the computer as prescribed in the well-known 12-week Elements of Computing Systems course (a.k.a. Nand 2 Tetris ? .org), originally developed by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Following these exercises, we continue the course using a high-level programming language, such as Mathematica, to translate the assembly language to machine language, and implement a virtual machine that runs the assembly language, a modern language compiler and a simple application on a primitive operating system, all in one semester. While building these subsystems, we will explicitly guide students to relate to their daily system design problems (such as scheduling meetings), and see the world in various computational abstractions. This computational thinking (CT) course differs from the original Nand 2 Tetris ? course not only by being longer (16 weeks) but also by emphasizing the governing principles and evolutionary history of computational abstraction using a functional paradigm. Our course extensively uses the functional programming paradigms as the basic building blocks of all computation. To accentuate this paradigm, we use Mathematica and a suite of open-source tools, such as Net Logo ? , to engage students in hands-on projects that demonstrate that all layers of computation are effectively the composition of functions. Given the previous test runs of this course, we observed that well-staged, yet inter-related technical challenges are keys to ensure desired learning outcomes. To motivate novice students to tackle challenging technical assignments such as building a CPU, we used the Extreme Learning Process (XLP) to orchestrate collective learning activities and empower students to explore solutions with various online tools. XLP is a system of collective knowledge management tools that uses Media Wiki ? and other computable knowledge data collection tools to capture personal and group learning activities. This captures collective learning experiences and encourages knowledge exchange between students with varying technical skill levels. Based on experiments in previous semesters, we found that when combining both rich programming models and systematic knowledge management workflow, students achieve higher learning outcomes and retain interest in the subject for longer terms. We also found that using Mathematica’s unifying functional abstraction to present both hardware and software design problems can reduce unnecessary tool-switching barriers, henceforth focusing their minds on computational abstractions. This streamlined and rich computational environment for the collective becomes a major contributing factor in our earlier successes.","Education"

Besides its key role for all living organisms, the study of water is very important in science and for many industrial applications, such as computational fluid dynamics, steam turbines, high-pressure devices and supercritical cycles. In 1995, the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam published a worldwide-accepted mathematical formulation that reproduces with maximum accuracy millions of experimental data obtained since 1824 up to the present time. This formulation is presented here in the form of a computable notebook written in the Wolfram Language in Mathematica 11.1. In natural complex systems such as aquifers, hydrocarbon reservoirs, geothermal systems and atmosphere-ocean interactions, water is one of the most important fluids in action. Geothermal reservoirs contain water in a wide thermodynamic range. The temperature gradient between the core and the surface of the Earth results from a continuous flow of natural heat, embracing all kinds of thermal energy resources that go from shallow depths (10^2 m), to medium depths (10^3 m) and to even deeper depths (10^4 m), reaching the immense temperatures of molten rocks. The fluids in these systems are at supercritical thermodynamic conditions, at more than 400° C and pressures larger than 220 bar, having higher fluid density and more heat available. They could provide twenty times as much power as the normal geothermal fluids used today. The aim of this paper is to provide a computational description of water from very low temperatures and pressures up to supercritical conditions, showing the power it represents.","Science/Engineering"

Specific examples of what works and what doesn’t work will be presented in the hopes that others interested in such an exercise may learn from our experiences. In particular, two successes will be presented. The first is the introduction of Mathematica in the three-course calculus sequence to first enhance teaching through visualization. In the second calculus course, simple programming assignments were introduced. Lastly, higher-level programming work was put into multivariable calculus. The most successful effort will be described, which was the development of a new Mathematica-based computational mathematics course, where the use of Mathematica to deal with the computational aspects of other courses in the curriculum was covered, including discrete mathematics, linear algebra, number theory and differential equations.

The course was built around Mathematica notebook segments that provided the core mathematics for the basic game theory and the differential geometry concepts of the theory using my recently published book Geometry, Language and Strategy: The Dynamics of Decision Processes, Vol. 2. The students were a mix of software, computer and electrical engineers. No prior experience with Mathematica, game theory or differential geometry was assumed. Based on this approach, the students used the provided notebook segments to compute the Nash equilibria and harmonic and transient harmonic behaviors for numerous examples from game theory. In the process, they learned the basics of Mathematica and were able to apply Mathematica's linear programming to get the game theory equilibria, as well as NDSolve to get the harmonic and transient behaviors, learning the concepts of decision process theory rather than focusing on what would have been formidable programming tasks. This talk will provide the details of the approach, samples of the notebook segments and lessons learned from teaching the course.","Education"

"2017.Stan.Wagon.The.Ultimate.Tetratorus","Stan Wagon","The Ultimate Tetratorus","In 1958, Świerczkowski showed that there is no chain of congruent regular tetrahedra T 1 ,..., T n that meet face to face, do not intersect except at the junction faces and close up (i.e. T n and T 1 share a face). Such chains do exist for the other four regular solids. In 2014, we showed that there is such a ""hoax chain"" so that there is a small gap—10 -18 —between a face of T n and a face of T 1 . The natural conjecture is that for any positive Ε, there is a tetrahedral chain with gap error below Ε. We have found a simple structure, having the limiting form of a rhombus, that yields such arbitrarily small error. The proof uses the close approximations to Π/(cos -1 2/3) given by continued fractions.","Math"
"2017.Francisco.Lacerda.Mod.Lex.Modeling.Early.Lexical","Francisco Lacerda","Mod Lex: Modeling Early Lexical Development","A stochastic model of lexical development and change is presented as an example of how Mathematica can be used to address linguistically relevant issues. The model simulates spontaneous stochastic interactions between ""mathematical agents"" endowed with a range of initial lexical abilities and characterized by different individual parameters like propensity for imitation, memory capacity or misunderstanding probability. In the simulated interaction process, an agent is randomly selected to produce an utterance. The length of the utterance is determined by a stochastic variable varying between zero (silence, no utterance) to the maximum reasonable utterance length. Non-silent utterances are assumed to have implicit, though a priori unknown, communicative meaning. Another agent in the immediate neighborhood of the speaking agent is assumed to hear the utterance, and responds with its own version of the utterance (ranging from perfect imitation to a completely new utterance, or just a silence). By varying the agents' parameters controlling imitation probability, probability of adding new sounds, memory span, etc., the model provides relevant empirical bases for the study of linguistic processes—like the early stages of the language acquisition or the social and areal spreading of linguistic trends—and the subsequent implementation of theoretically sound mathematical models describing such processes.","Science/Engineering"

Then we do theoretic definition and programming of simple monads. Next, we discuss a general approach to monad programming utilization. (Both software design and implementation.) The last part of the presentation comprises ""real life"" examples of tasks from data analysis, machine learning, and natural language processing that are done using monadic programming.","Software Development"

Given the new functionality in Mathematica 11 and the recent addition of two 3D printers at my high school, I have just begun to explore the possibilities. In this talk, I plan to share my successes and struggles as a student of 3D printing and describe how it can be used as another vehicle for learning in the high-school setting. I will share my experience with various ways to create models using different approaches to 3D graphics within Mathematica. Even as an experienced user, I know there is still much to learn. However, even at just the beginning of this journey, it has been amazing to see how students can apply mathematics to take something from the textbook page and then hold it in their hands.

It is the experience of this author that beginning students in complex analysis often find the subject of multivalued functions a formidable undertaking that more than infrequently discourages the student from further pursuing the subject. With the help of Mathematica, we tackle a particularly difficult but beautiful problem of mapping a double cover of the complex plane onto a normal Riemann surface, a torus. Multivalued functions become single-valued on their Riemann surface, and the foundation of complex analysis of single-valued functions can be applied over these surfaces, including Laurent's theorem and the residue theorem.","Math"

Employing state-of-the-art mathematical and numerical methods, Tcheby Flow ? delivers numerical results of arbitrary precision, i.e. precision that is totally controlled by the user. We offer a full package starting from building the mathematical model, constructing the solver and finally providing the understanding of the result. Tcheby Flow ? ’s method has several advantages over all the finite methods. Finite methods were designed to be used with 60s computers. They supply low-order approximations of the solution. Their mathematical foundation makes them unable to control the precision of their results, which therefore prevents them from taking advantage of ever-increasing computation power and efficiency. In contrast, Tcheby Flow ? solvers can harvest today's computation power to its fullest potential. Our efficiency also comes from mixing symbolic manipulation and numerical calculation at the same level of precision—therefore using Mathematica to its full potential while exceeding its capabilities. Tcheby Flow ? results for the integro-differential solvers are indeed supplied with any number of accurate digits, just like Mathematica does for the evaluation pi. That is guaranteed.","Engineering/Science"
"2017.Rodrigo.A.Obando.A.Guided.Tour.of.the","Rodrigo A. Obando","A Guided Tour of the ECA and Beyond A ? Guided Tour of the ECA and Beyond","We have studied the Elementary Cellular Automata rule space for many decades. Ever since Langdon's Lambda, we have associated the number of 1s in a rule to indicate that some kind of dynamic behaviour is introduced in the evolution of the rule. We know that Langdon's Lambda helped at that time but it was not always indicative of the amount of dynamic behaviour in the evolution of a given cellular automata rule. If we were to follow that idea, rule 0 would not introduce any kind of change in the evolution. The fact is that it does introduce change at the very beginning of the evolution: after one step all cells are 0. Rule 255 is the counterpart of rule 0, it introduces change at the very beginning and the output of the rule is all cells are 1 after the first evolution step. Obando introduced a different way of describing the rules in a paper in Complex Systems. The mapping allowed for defining a different set of Lambdas instead of just one Lambda as in the case of Langdon's. This allowed to partially-order the rules from no dynamic behaviour to the maximum possible. The rule that has no dynamic behavior is the identity rule, rule 204. The rule what would have the maximum change possible is the complement rule, rule 51. We can display all rules in the ECA, from 204 to 51 using a series of lattices. We can use the same layout to explore the space between two connected rules in the ECA that are mapped onto the rule space with radius 2. Using this technique, we can explore, for example, the space between rule 206 and rule 110 by mapping those rules to the rule space with radius 2. We can then continue on and explore another part of the space in the rule space with radius 3, radius 4 and so on. An interesting finding in one of these experiments is that, in rule space radius 2, we find a rule that is visually similar to 110 but it seems that rule 110 is a blurred version of that rule.","Math"

This motion is described theoretically and simulated using Mathematicat. Moreover, this motion is successfully realized experimentally. Experimental data is compared with the theoretical results. Students of the faculty of science solve similar problems in the course of theoretical mechanics. Nowadays, we use Mathematica for the solution of this theoretical problem.

The contemporary and popular definition of Computational Thinking has been stripped of its power. Computational Thinking as a ""forge for ideas"" has been replaced with the basic, and low-level techniques of Computer Science. It is our belief that these techniques are important in a deep study of computer science, but, as Stephen Wolfram himself explains, they are not the correct place to start. The Wolfram Language enables Computational Thinking in a profound way: It is a professional tool that is fully accessible to students. Most other tools used to teach Computational Thinking are stripped down, ""toy"" versions that will each be outgrown. With the Wolfram Language, we have a professional tool that has enabled deep and meaningful computational and mathematical thinking and problem solving among all students at a depth we've only previously imagined possible.

Despite their proven potential, these methods have not been widely used by the academic community and modeling practitioners. One of the major obstacles toward broad adoption has been the difficulty in performing the analyses; a process that up to now required multiple translations across software platforms and detailed understanding of the methods to deal with coding exceptions. In this session, we will demonstrate an integrated tool that allows us to perform a structural dominance analysis by leveraging Mathematica symbolic computations using a simple integrated interface. The tool automates all computations and the elaboration of tables and graphs for detailed analysis, and is flexible enough to localize the analysis with a few clicks; it can also efficiently explain dynamic behavior using elements of system structure.

But many aspects of these objects remain mysterious. Prime among these is the nature of their interiors, the regions inside the event horizon� from which no light can escape. These are unobservable by definition, and can only be explored mathematically. Visualization tools like Mathematica are thus our best hope to explore this part of the universe The interior structure of rotating black holes is complex and typically illustrated with the help of special coordinates. But any such coordinate choice necessarily results in a distorted view, just as a flat map of the Earth is necessarily distorted by the choice of projection. The truest way to depict the properties of a black hole is through quantities that are coordinate invariant. Mathematicians have shown that there are at most 17 such curvature invariants describing spacetime inside the most general possible black holes (those with mass, charge and spin). We have developed Mathematica code to compute and plot all these quantities for the first time. The resulting images are far more complex and beautiful than those that are found in the existing literature. In our presentation, we will briefly outline the physical motivation, describe some of the coding challenges that had to be overcome, present the resulting plots and discuss some of the implications.","Engineering/Science"

The perceived color of a photonic structure comes from its characteristic interactions with light, which are dictated by its materials, geometry, and orientation to the viewer. A number of promising applications require the ability to inverse-design photonic structures with specific colors, but this is a highly under-constrained task. \n \nThis paper describes an adaptive mesh search technique used to design photonic structures with specific perceived colors. The technique is built on MathematicaÃ¢Â€Â™s extensive color functionality, namely the functions Color Distance ? [] and Color Convert ? []. The adaptive mesh search technique is very efficient and results are returned within seconds or minutes on a laptop computer, eliminating the need for cluster computing. The method can be applied to any well-characterized geometry, and can thus be used for all color-based applications of photonic structures, including pigment-free paints, anti-counterfeiting materials, and reflective displays. In this work, the adaptive mesh search is applied to 1D, 2D, and 3D photonic structures, and the resulting designs are satisfactory matches with the desired colors.","Engineering/Science"

Lensing galaxies are extremely valuable in cosmological studies since they provide the ideal laboratories for studying the very distant universe by providing unprecedented details of distant sources for what otherwise would have been a few bright pixels on the most powerful telescopes. However, finding these natural telescopes among millions of galaxies (per square degree) can be a challenging task. I will discuss utilization of Mathematica in generating a training dataset by simulating gravitational lenses and by training convolutional neural networks to identify real lenses in large astronomical surveys. I will further demonstrate how Mathematica can be an alternative to Google's Tensor Flow ? and convey my experience using external GPUs to train deep learning algorithms on Mathematica. These results will be published in The Astrophysical Journal .","Engineering/Science"

By eliminating the error-prone, tedious and inconvenient iterations of the lower-level source code, the Microcontroller Kit provides greater flexibility and efficiency to the overall project workflow. Even in situations when the number of iterations are low or not necessary, it can help get the project off the ground faster because it obviates the need to directly write code for the microcontroller. This talk will introduce the Microcontroller Kit using several hardware examples, and will also demo a speed controller deployed to control a brushed DC motor with an integrated encoder.

To add enhancements, companies are forced to write code in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) or to develop independent packages, typically written in languages such as C/C++ or C# to run more complicated computations. All of these are complicated, time-consuming tasks. In particular, the difficulty of updating and maintaining these packages frequently leads to many problems. Wolfram Cloud Connector for Excel solves these problems by allowing full access to the Wolfram Language with its suite of computational solutions. This is done through the API technology provided by Wolfram Enterprise Private Cloud (EPC). Code is deployed once to the cloud and instantly becomes accessible to everyone in an organization that shares EPC. End users of the Cloud Connector for Excel require no Wolfram Language expertise whatsoever. This reduces training time required to access potentially complicated calculations. Developers are able to write in the Wolfram Language, reducing time spent coding solutions. Finally, systems administrators work with a centralized hub, which reduces time spent troubleshooting end users’ machines and updating and controlling access to coding solutions.","Software Development"

On the racecourse, decisions have to be made quickly about many aspects of boat handling, such as sail trim, whether to tack or jibe, whether the wind has shifted, and whether to change sails. Most boats have at least some instruments to guide these decisions, but a simple gauge showing wind direction and heading is a limited amount of information, especially when there is so much else to concentrate on. This summer I decided to create race management software for my boat using the Wolfram Engine and the Wolfram Cloud. Commercial and open source packages exist for some of these tasks, but I knew that I could use the power of Wolfram technologies to create a custom and extensible solution that would provide exactly the information I wanted, and would embody my own personal sailing strategies. The core of the system is a laptop computer attached to the boat's instrument network, running Mathematica to continuously sample and analyze data coming from the instruments. The same Mathematica process also acts as a web server, making raw data and strategic analysis available to an Android tablet in the cockpit. I even have an Amazon Echo device in the cockpit that provides a custom voice interface, which is a real help when you've got the tiller in one hand and the mainsheet in the other.

I will introduce a new technique, based on two 1D-convolutional neural networks, that allows real-time detection and parameter estimation of GW signals whose amplitudes are much weaker than the background noise. This uses data derived from high-performance physics simulations on supercomputers, including Blue Waters, to train neural networks on GPUs using the Wolfram Language. I will also discuss my recent work on applying transfer learning and unsupervised clustering methods in the Wolfram Language for classifying anomalous noise transients in spectrograms of LIGO data. I will conclude with an overview of my ongoing research on extracting weak signals from LIGO data using denoising auto-encoders based on recurrent neural networks with an attention mechanism.

Two key assumptions play a central role in this analysis: a model for the strategies each player owns; and a model for the connection between the game value and the coupling each player has to the game (their engagement). It is well known that some games appear to be naturally zero-sum, such as the rock–scissors–paper game. Other games are known to be non-zero-sum, such as the prisoner's dilemma and the different variants of the game of chicken. We describe how the partial differential equations are solved using the Wolfram Language in a Mathematica notebook. Then, using this notebook, we demonstrate how these games differ. One interesting insight is the possibility of looking at rock–scissors–paper as a non-zero-sum game. As part of this exercise, we come to a generalization of the Nash equilibrium to steady-state behaviors, which we call neutral behavior.","Math & Science"

Bishop Nicole led the way when he proved that the harmonic series diverges. Later, Euler showed that if even powers are applied to the harmonic series, they all have closed for representations, involving the same powers of pi and the Bernoulli numbers. Riemann expanded the series to have imaginary exponents. This function became known as the zeta function. His mentor and friend, Dirichlet, extended the alternating harmonic function, naming it the eta function. The well-known relationship of the zeta function and the eta function allowed Riemann access to the critical strip above and below the continuum in the complex plane. Riemann's functional equation proved that all negative even integers as exponents lead to the ""trivial zeros"" of his function. It also gave him all zeta function values to the left of the imaginary axis in the complex plane. In 1859, Riemann postulated that all nontrivial zeta zeros are imaginary numbers, whose real parts are one half. A remarkable relationship is unfolded, proving the relationship among M ( p ), the Mersenne number, and Dirichlet's eta function plus Riemann's zeta function. A contemporary of Riemann was Dmitri Mendeleev, born in Siberia. He became famous throughout Europe for his discoveries in chemistry, mainly his periodic table of elements.","Math & Science"

We assert the expansive field of software development (arguably both a trade and an aspiring engineering discipline) has stymied efforts to date to build reliable pathways to expertise—and a robust labor force. The most recent experiment is the ~3–6 month developer ""bootcamp"" training model, which has (no surprise) flooded the job market with just-barely-hireable graduates, exceeding demand for low-skill roles while not meeting the still-high demand for proficient or expert developers. We propose a software developer training model based on long-term, geographically distributed, part-time apprenticeships, which begin in high school and continue through graduation from a four-year university degree program. And we advocate the Wolfram Language as the preferred training language for apprentices. We will present demos of early portfolio projects developed by our high-school-student trainees, followed by a detailed explanation of Augment's software developer training model and why we have chosen the Wolfram Language as our training language (instead of e.g. Python, Java or C++).

My use case was in our Student Association election at Georgetown, but the strategies can apply to several different instances as long as there is a core team of three or more other people to collaborate with. The first step I will show is the process of creating and cleaning a spreadsheet with a master list of prospects—most easily done using Facebook or another social media platform. Afterward, I will present a program in the Wolfram Language which segments the prospects into tiers based on friendship with the core team. From this tier system, the core team can divide the work of recruiting staff members, and they immediately have a pool of additional prospects from which the staff can choose. With proper analytics, tight organization and the power of word of mouth, Mathematica can help any cause spread—fast. The basic human psychology making these strategies effective lies in our willingness to perform favors if it is a close friend that asks us. At each step, the core team or staff member interacting with a prospect are the most optimal people available to persuade him or her. When performed correctly, these strategies can assist a core team to spread a message to a group 20+ times its size with relative ease.","Data Science"

Inside each cluster, the data points (i.e. the protests) would be connected by a spanning tree, while the tree's edge (i.e. jump pattern) can be fitted by an exponential distribution. There are two main drivers in the protest spread: geographical diffusion and burst, acting in the long and short timeframes, respectively.

A special set of intersections is the equilateral Morley triangle M . Moreover, there exists lines joining the vertices of T and M that intersect at the same point. T and M are thus in perspective. Moreover, three couples of lines of sight intersect at three points aligned on the Desargues line. Here, all the triangles created intersecting the trisectors, and not only the Morley triangle, are shown to be in perspective with T and between them. This is a new fact. Moreover, complexity enters with the seemingly endless generation of triangles built with the centers of perspective, the Desargues lines or both. At that level, symbolic calculations become very complicated, and a limitation is imposed by the power of the computer and cloud computing, yet not tested; using supercomputers should extend the investigation of the properties of the various patterns related to the trisectors of a triangle. The exploration of such fields of geometry is an ideal application of Mathematica to education and research.

Also, it shows how the instructional materials are based on Mathematica notebooks, as well as the engagement of students in such activity. As engineering courses are facing the challenge of including interdisciplinary subjects keeping, or even reducing, the credit hours in the classroom, well-developed Mathematica notebooks can provide a graphic and interactive way for students to experiment, in a graphic interface, some topics whose mathematical demonstrations are not so simple. It is particularly useful for subjects that are not part of the ""core"" subjects, such as basic and applied electricity, for a non-electrical engineering program, such as chemical or production engineering. Notebooks were developed to demonstrate the impact of reactive electric power in the magnitude and phase of supplied current for a given load, or how the rotating fields are induced in electrical motors. Notebooks with more complex functionalities were developed to clarify advanced topics even for electrical engineering students, such as circuits with relays and timers, asymmetric short-circuit calculation, operation curves for wind turbines and generators, and curve-based selection of electric motors.

"2018.Thomas.Weber.Tobias.Weber.Bike.Racing.with.Mathematica","Thomas Weber/Tobias Weber","Bike Racing with Mathematica","Ten years ago, Wolfram started to introduce geographic functionality in Mathematica, and this functionality has grown substantially. In 2015, Travel Directions ? was added, which allows for travel planning for driving, biking and walking. There are some assumptions connected with the travel method biking, e.g. ""biking on allowed paths at 18 km/h."" Bikers differ substantially in their speeds, so this assumption does not fit for all. Also, the climbing abilities of bikers are also very different, so a basic question is always ""over the top of the hill or around?"". Here we use Mathematica to develop a model of bike-tour planning for a bike race across Europe using the geo functionality of Mathematica and the ability to collect, combine and analyse data from diverse sources like Open Street Map ? , Strava—a website used to track cycling activity via GPS—and Google Street View. We demonstrate that bike-tour planning calibrated to estimate power measures retrieved from Strava gives interesting insight. We think that this is a novel approach.","Data Science"

"2018.Andrew.Hanson.Matching.Paired.Sets.of.Space","Andrew Hanson","Matching Paired Sets of Space and Orientation Data","We examine the problem of transforming matching collections of data points into optimal correspondence. The classic root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) method calculates a 3D rotation that minimizes the RMSD of a set of test data points relative to a reference set of corresponding points. Similar literature in aeronautics, photogrammetry and proteomics employs numerical methods to find the maximal eigenvalue of a particular 4x4 quaternion-based matrix, thus specifying the quaternion eigenvector corresponding to the optimal 3D rotation. Here we generalize this basic problem, sometimes referred to as the Procrustes problem, and present algebraic solutions that exhibit properties that are inaccessible to traditional numerical methods. We begin with the 4D data problem, a problem one dimension higher than the conventional 3D problem, but one that is also solvable by quaternion methods; we then study the 3D and 2D data problems as special cases. In addition, we consider data that is itself a quaternion isomorphic to orthonormal triads describing 3D coordinate frames (amino acids in proteins possess such frames). Adopting a reasonable approximation to the exact quaternion-data minimization problem, we find a novel closed form ""quaternion RMSD"" (QRMSD) solution for the optimal rotation from a quaternion dataset to a reference set. We observe that composites of the RMSD and QRMSD measures can also be solved with these methods.","Math & Science"

AIMSPP is controlled through the Wolfram Language, and consequently has the potential to learn additional behavior as it moves about in simulated oceans and interacts with various aquatic creatures within them. In utilizing Unity Link ? , we encountered several challenges which ended up being solved in revealing and sometimes unorthodox ways, providing valuable lessons along the way. Circumstances engendered innovative and unconventional uses of techniques and features, from cross-software dialog boxes to asynchronous scene management. Unexpected difficulties that were solved included issues of controlling program state, object hierarchy and proper instancing. AIMSPP was built to provide opportunities for students that require computational thinking, and that brought with it certain design challenges such as delayed instructions and level loading, to which fascinating solutions for all were found.","Engineering & Modeling"

This embodied learning approach combines roleplaying that follows a sci-fi scenario, along with teamwork, to devise and conduct simulations and experiments. The narrative involves a group of scientists from the Cetacean Intelligence and Communications Investigation Lab (CICIL) in training for an upcoming voyage of discovery to a peculiar and desolate area called the Caribbean Trapezoid. A robotic sea turtle named AIMSPP (Artificially Intelligent Multi-sensory Signal and Pattern Perceiver) will accompany the ship Riff Raft on the exploratory mission. AIMSPP will be instrumental in providing navigational guidance and reconnaissance, albeit necessitating that the vessel's crew members be conversant in the Wolfram Language (AIMSPP's native tongue.) But there's more to the story. A troupe of wild yet playful dolphins known as A Pod Calypso have taken refuge in the Caribbean Trapezoid. Despite an intense curiosity that strongly attracts them toward harmonious syncopated tunes, rhythmic movement and colorful geometric patterns, they cautiously remain distant and avoid direct engagement with humans (contrary to typical tropical cetaceans). Consequently, after being instructed by the squad from CICIL on how to exhibit expressive body language and generate enthralling sounds, AIMSPP will be sent as a harbinger to convey universally meaningful and friendly intentions. The researchers' conjecture that having AIMSPP conduct clever interactive song-and-dance routines (composed from myriad mixes of music, motion, math and media) will draw A Pod Calypso to observe and eventually perform in synchrony, thereby producing ""close encounters of the math kind.""","Engineering & Modeling"

"2018.Rohit.Panse.Using.Machine.Learning.to.Diagnose","Rohit Panse","Using Machine Learning to Diagnose Pneumonia","Pneumonia is an infection that causes inflammation in one or both of the lungs; it is induced by a variety of organisms: bacteria, viruses and fungus. Bacterial pneumonia, the most common type, is caused by bacteria that multiplies in the lungs; viral pneumonia is caused by an array of viruses, the most common one being influenza. Although the severity of pneumonia can vary, young children, seniors and people with weakened immune systems are the most vulnerable. The CDC reports that of the close to 540,000 cases of pneumonia each year, 50,000 people die. Early and proper diagnosis can tremendously decrease mortality rate. Conventional diagnosis methods like examining patient medical history and symptoms have their shortcomings. Dutch researchers, who published their findings in the European Respiratory Journal , found that of 140 patients who had their pneumonia diagnosed by x-ray, doctors initially thought only 41 of them had the severe lung infection. Chest x-rays have long been reliable diagnostic tools for pneumonia. Since pneumonia is an air-space disease, patients' air spaces are filled with bacteria, viruses, pus and other microorganisms. A diagnosis is determined by infiltrates, or white spots, present in a chest x-ray. My project uses a convolutional neural network to diagnose the type of pneumonia that a patient has.

A lot of maths is involved in creating models and solving them. Indeed, most of the talks at the Wolfram Technology Conferences have been focused on stages two and three of the four-step algorithm for problem solving: define the question; translate into maths; compute the answers; and interpret the results. However, Mathematica has not only made it much easier to solve traditional problems in science and engineering, where models are typically systems of differential equations, but it has also effectively redefined what can be considered to be a mathematical problem. This change, which has been occurring in mathematics for more than 100 years, forces a reconsideration of the types of problems that may be considered to be ""maths"" in the first place, and especially how interpretation becomes key in both the translation phase and the interpretation of the results. The widened scope of possibilities begs for new ideas about the entire process. In the humanities, the art of hermeneutics has developed as a method for interpretation. In its modern form, based on the work of philosophers such as Heidegger, Gadamer and Derrida, its scope has widened beyond its original application to the interpretation of texts to a general theory of interpretation. This talk is about the intersection of traditional model building and hermeneutics as a bridge between maths and the humanities.","Math & Science"

In its basic form, the slides are labeled as corresponding to healthy or cancerous tissues. While the former has a normal structure and distribution of the glands and the nuclei, in the latter the composition of the slide becomes chaotic. Still, the degree of disorder of the components varies depending on the degree of the cancer. Therefore, a more challenging classification task also targets the discrimination among histopathological slides showing different degrees of cancer. Discerning among different degrees is often subjective for pathologists, as there can be distinct opinions for certain slides, with variance arising in both inter-observer and intra-observer situations. The first attempt of dealing with this particular dataset is based on crafting measurable features from images and then classifying the samples using the extracted numerical attributes. This led to an accuracy of almost 84% for a four-class dataset that was primarily used for tests. Using an initial convolutional neural network (CNN) approach, an accuracy of 91% was alternatively obtained. Next, using Mathematica and the (almost magical) function Classify, we were able to reach accuracies between 87% and 94% using various machine learning classifiers. Later, using a novel CNN architecture, the results reached 95%. Using a tandem of seven classifiers in Mathematica (without CNN), along with some optimization, the results reached the current peak of 98% correctly classified samples.","Data Science"

Under these conditions, wavefronts change directions due to multiple reflections from the obstacles. The general concept is to represent the transmitted signal as a collection of rays and calculate the path of each such ray following the obstacles in its way. Existing tools and packages for ray tracing usually discretize the obstacles using triangulation and provide a set of functions to calculate the reflection, refraction and scattering from a triangle of given material properties. In addition, functions for fast selection of the triangle for a specific ray are of great concern, as the number of triangles is large, and usually many rays are involved. However, due to efficiency concerns, the tools are difficult to master, and one finds it difficult to add functionality for specific needs. The author developed a ray-tracing simulation of electromagnetic waves in urban environment (information from a digital map of a real city) with ground-based transmitters, and receivers positioned on drones flying above it. The vast capabilities of Mathematica were exploited for graphical representation of the scenario and rays, geometry-based calculation that eliminates the need for triangulation, and speeding up the computation using its multi-core support using various ""Parallel"" variants of iterations.","Engineering & Modeling"

Every semester, teachers need to select, write up, solve and evaluate a collection of problems to guide students and assess their success. In our department we teach large, coordinated classes. For instance, Differential Calculus has 1,600+ students enrolled in 24 different sessions that are all evaluated simultaneously. The course coordinator is in charge of selecting weekly problem sheets for evaluations and recitations. Mathematica, and its ability to parse, read and create text files, has helped us make this chore much easier and better. We keep a large database of problems in La Te X ? that can be read as a Dataset object in the Wolfram Language. We then perform queries on the dataset and are able to construct customizable La Te X ? documents with selected problems, their associated figures and a solution manual in the form of a Mathematica notebook. For evaluations, we again use these tools to create unique exams for each student or recitation session by managing the student lists and varying parameters in the problems.","Data Science & AI"

"2018.Jeff.Burns.A.Seed.Sorting.Machine.Using","Jeff Burns","A Seed Sorting Machine Using the Wolfram Language","A seed sorting machine has been developed that uses the Wolfram Language for the main control loop, user interface, and classification engine. The seeds being sorted are a variety of corn that is easy for cows to digest. Breeding this corn requires selecting only the kernels that are substantially opaque. Historically, this has been accomplished by manual sorting on a light table. This process has a significant false positive rate. Our machine uses a novel light and camera arrangement to photograph each kernel. The images are captured by a Wolfram Language program. The images are processed to center the kernel in the image and segment it from the background. A custom neural network is used to classify the kernel. The false positive rate for the automated sorter is twice as good as a human sorter. The Wolfram language main program starts a sort sequence by sending a serial command to an Arduino that runs a stepper motor until a seed is released. As the seed drops, it is photographed. When the photograph arrives, it is classified by the Wolfram language control program. The Arduino controller is then instructed to place the seed in the appropriate bin. This talk will describe how the Wolfram Language was used throughout the development process and allowed us to deliver a working system without recoding.","Engineering & Modeling"

Our approach is to program algorithms to solve problems and then look for patterns. Based on the patterns we find, we make conjectures and then prove these conjectures. The richness of this problem is such that activities can be created from it that are suitable for students ranging from grammar school to graduate school. The teaching philosophy behind our approach is associated with names like Polya, Ross, and Moore, and it has a long track record of producing mathematical excellence. We have found that Mathematica provides an ideal platform for the experimental approach to doing mathematics as well for supporting a pedagogy based in discovery. Essentially, students learn math the same way mathematicians do research!","Math & Science"

Success using these new paradigms depends upon the availability of new technologies for system modeling, analysis and communication, some of which are now part of the Wolfram technology stack built using the Wolfram Language and Modelica. This presentation will explain how B&I has gradually augmented the services it provides over the past four years, starting with early attempts at building desktop multi-physics models using System Modeler ? , and ending with a current cloud-based application. At each step we will exhibit live examples of how the technology stack was deployed and discuss the remaining obstacles. Transitioning from today's conventional workflows to a digital engineering approach comes with significant people, hardware and software challenges—for example, most systems encompass multi-physics domains that include fluid flow, chemistry, material behavior, sensing and control. Modeling is further complicated by the fact that few operations are steady-state. Virtualizing the operability of a complex system is therefore challenging from the get-go and requires collaboration across multiple engineering disciplines. But it can be done, and B&I has used Wolfram products to develop model-based enterprise skills that dovetail with our more conventional systems safety engineering skill set. As you will see, the end result is our ability to virtualize real industrial systems as part of the design and optimization workflow.","Engineering & Modeling"

On their faces, algorithm analysis, function approximation and number theory seem radically different. After all, the first is about computer programs, the second is about smooth functions and the third is about whole numbers. However, they share a common toolset: asymptotic relations and the important concept of asymptotic scale. By comparing the ""important parts"" of two functions—a common trick in mathematics—asymptotic analysis classifies functions based on the relative size of their absolute values near a particular point. Depending on the application, this comparison provides quantitative answers to questions such as ""which of these algorithms is fastest"" or ""is function f a good approximation to function g ?"". In this talk, we will survey six asymptotic relations introduced in Version 11.3 of the Wolfram Language, their applications and their connections to the asymptotic solvers featured in a related talk.","Math & Science"

Tasks in digital pathology range from image segmentation and tissue classification to visualizing mitotic events. We will consider a subset of these tasks for the purpose of this talk. Segmenting the epithelium is important since regions of cancer are typically present in the epithelium. Histologic patterns within the stroma are known to be important in predicting overall survival and outcome in breast cancer patients. On the other hand, the morphology of tubules has a direct relationship with the aggressiveness of cancer. In benign cases, the tubules are more organized and have similar size and properties, but in cancerous tissues, this organization is absent, and with the increase in gradual stages of cancer, the variation in the tubule structure increases, making segmenting tubular structures for cancerous tissue an extremely difficult task. The Wolfram Neural Net Repository offers a variety of models to perform image segmentation and classification tasks. We will consider models from the repository and also learn how to build models from scratch and train them on different tasks that pertain to classifying cancer from non-cancer classes and how we can identify the different regions from H&E stained tissues.","Data Science & AI"

It is also thought many other species perform symbolic expressions that don’t serve pure or obvious biological functions. What could be so useful about “art” that it would be so pervasive? Using examples and theory, this talk reframes art as a critical computational approach to efficiently explore large possibility spaces that the assumed power of mathematics, statistics, deep learning, NLP and other “AI” approaches cannot replicate. This talk demonstrates that all these approaches are really subsets of an artistic process. Art provides for the exploration of spaces not covered when learning towards or optimization is the goal. Art does this primarily by generating its own space of possibilities that brings observers into shared consequences. Art is its own theorem and its own proof, a simulation of event and consequences. It is this shared computing process of artist and audience where new possibilities of reality emerge. Art is play. Art is humor. Art is the existence theorem. Art is efficient and essential for biological entities, especially social species, in order to simulate shared consequences before those consequences are committed to in an irreversible way. This unsupervised generative simulation with perturbation process is a necessary and sufficient condition for general AI—in fact, it is the only possible basis capable of general AI.

"2019.Claudio.Parazzoli.Considerations.for.a.Quantum.Package","Claudio Parazzoli","Considerations for a Quantum Package in the Wolfram Language","The rapid evolution of quantum technology has not been met by an equivalent maturing of the numerical algorithms for simulating quantum mechanical processes. We are now in the same position that computational electrodynamics (CE) was in circa 1980. We have the theory, but we can solve only a limited set of problems. Computational quantum mechanics (CQM) will expedite the maturing of quantum technologies as CE did for electromagnetism. Mathematica needs a robust package for Dirac notations, with capabilities similar to the Matrix package. In this talk we’ll show how the unsupported Dirac package by Louis Gomez is used to improve the performance of a Mach–Zehnder interferometer by photon addition. In CE, there are six topologically different ordinary differential equations (ODE) in time, for the components of the electromagnetic tensor, in each point in spacetime. This results in a set of ODEs easily integrated. In CQM problems, there is a large number, in the millions, of topologically different ODEs, for the matrix elements of the unitary operator describing the quantum process. Mathematica, with the help of the Dirac package, generates all the required ODEs. Upon integration of the ODEs, the evolution of the density matrix can be computed with all the expectation values of the operators of interest. The available tools for the evaluation of the expectation values are slow; thus, an improved set of functions for this purpose would be extremely useful.

First, subjects are deemed to be induced into either a mindless or a mindful condition through a spot-the-difference exercise where a sequence of random images are automatically modified to a degree of difficulty proxied for through image distances. “Mindless” condition subjects are shown relatively easy spot-the-difference pairs of pictures, while “mindful” subjects are shown more difficult ones. Next, subjects in both conditions complete a survey to measure standard biases to which truly mindful subjects should be less prone. They are also assessed on the 21-point Langer Mindfulness Scale. Then, electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements, taken throughout the study of each participant using a portable headband, are clustered and classified to determine the extent to which mindfulness is computationally measurable. Finally, subjects in both groups are shown a variety of spot-the-difference challenges of computationally known but undisclosed difficulty, and a correlation analysis is performed on the degree to which that actual difficulty varies with their live EEG measurements transformed into mindfulness probabilities using the clusters and machine learning classification computed earlier. In other words, we test the idea that mindfulness can be induced without meditation, practice, breathing exercises or even intent, but merely through the targeted presentation of an automated spot-the-difference game.

The IAPWS IF-97 standard distributes thermodynamic data into nonintersecting zones of thermodynamic state prescribed by a (pressure, temperature) tuple, to which region-specific equations of state are applied to evaluate thermodynamic properties such as specific enthalpy, specific entropy, specific internal energy, etc. I compare the efficacy of out-of-the-box Predict and a heuristic neural network created using NetTrain to approximate the crucial thermodynamic property, specific enthalpy, given a large dataset extracted from the IAPWS steam data. In this demonstration, specific enthalpies (J/kg) of steam as a function of pressure (P, bar) and temperature (T, Celsius) are first imported. Multiple different data-sample organizations and prediction/approximation objects are used: (1) an out-of-the-box (ootb), gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) prediction object (Predict[]) is trained on the full dataset; (2) an ootb-GBDT is trained on a single isobar; and (3) a heuristic multilayer neural network (HPNN, NetTrain[]) is trained on the entire dataset, a single isobar and individual zones. It is observed that the HPNN is faster than GBDT and possesses greater accuracy when data is distributed into zones per the IAPWS standard. The current objective is to use the thermodynamic approximator example here as an experiential learning tool to demystify machine learning and neural networks for mechanical engineering students with a traditionally noncomputing coursework backgrounds.

For a single time series, we apply both Wolfram Language built-in algorithms and additional specialized algorithms. We discuss in more detail algorithms based on  <i>k</i> -nearest neighbors (KNN), dimension reduction, linear regression, quantile regression and prefix trees. For collections of time series, we discuss: transformations into uniform representations, simple outlier finding based on variable distributions, anomalous trend finding, anomaly finding with KNN and other related algorithms.

"2019.Casey.Mulligan.PhD.Automated.Economic.Reasoning.with.Mathematica","Casey Mulligan, PhD","Automated Economic Reasoning with Mathematica","The social sciences have been profoundly affected by progress in information technology that has facilitated the collection and processing of vast amounts of data related to human activity. Information technology has so far assisted less with theoretical reasoning. Computers have already been used for generating numerical examples, but approximation quality is a concern, and more thinking is always needed to appreciate the generality of the results from examples. TheoryGuru is user-friendly software that, without approximation, automates reasoning in the social sciences. The reasoning is about connecting assumptions with conclusions, each of which is expressed with a finite number of symbols. Examples feature algebraic symbols that represent real numbers (e.g. prices, the number of votes for the Democratic candidate, etc.), vectors of real numbers and real-valued functions of those variables (e.g. quantity demanded as a function of price). Assumptions of this type could come from statistical theory, or any number of social theories that are not necessarily derived from optimization. More importantly, reasoning can begin with purely qualitative assumptions. We may not be ready to assume, say, how much price reduces quantity demanded, or that the demand function takes a specific form (e.g. linear or log-linear); we only know that the relationship is negative. Assumptions and conclusions that formerly took a social scientist hours or even days to connect can now be done in seconds with fewer chances for human error.  Indeed, the automation advantage is especially large with qualitative systems—systems of inequalities—as compared to equation systems.

These DiffyQNets are trained through a stochastic gradient descent–like method. This implemented functionality consists of a set of functions: DiffyQNet, DiffyQNetSim, DiffyQNetTrain and DiffyQNetPlot. In the presented case, DiffyQNet dictates the behavior of a bilayer of an antiferromagnet and a normal metal using a DiffyQ described in [1–2]. Then, DiffyQNetSim simulates the results of an application of DiffyQNetTrain. Finally, the resulting actions of the system are shown using DiffyQNetPlot. We find that AND, OR and XOR gates can be simulated using NDSolve, with over 200 iterative computations occurring in under three seconds. By demonstrating this system with simple gates, we show that this method is not overly computationally intensive to classify larger systems like the MNIST database. These results thus provide impetus to the continued development of this project for generalized time-dependent DiffyQNets.

"2019.Maegan.Jennings.Using.Mathematica.to.Explain.the","Maegan Jennings","Using Mathematica to Explain the Darkness of the Night Sky","The sky is dark at night, even though the universe is infinite and uniformly filled with light sources. Think about that for a second. Why don’t we see galaxies in every direction, just as we see trees in every direction in the middle of a large forest? This question is known as Olbers' paradox in cosmology. Its resolution is known to be mostly due to the fact that the speed of light and the age of the universe are both finite (and, to a lesser extent, the fact that space is expanding). But do these factors explain the entire darkness of the night sky? There is also a dusty intergalactic medium (IGM) that is particularly good at absorbing visible light and reradiating it at longer wavelengths. Observations of quasar reddening are now becoming sensitive enough to constrain the properties of the IGM, but its quantitative effect on the spectral intensity of the extragalactic background light has yet to be established. We use Mathematica to calculate this intensity within standard relativistic cosmology, representing the light of galaxies with multiple blackbody functions at different redshifts, and convolving it with a detailed model for intergalactic dust. A crucial feature is the use of ListInterpolation to calculate dust opacity as a function of redshift and wavelength, reducing a time-consuming double integral to a much faster single integral. Our results suggest that intergalactic dust may play a more significant role in darkening the night sky than has usually been thought.

Perhaps it could be only damage on the covering; however, a structural collapse also starts with a tiny crack. Therefore, it is very important to identify the emergence of them. Continuous monitoring of cracks is the follow-up of the appearance and aggravation of cracks to determine the appropriate method for the treatment of the pathology; this could have been the solution for huge disasters around the world where cracks were the first sign of a serious defect that affected the stability of the building. Given the importance of continuous monitoring of cracks, this presentation shows how Mathematica receives images obtained by a microscope. At each frame, two feature points are tracked and their positions compared to show the displacement between them in a period of time, evidencing the opening or closing of the crack.  This method improves the technique of tracking cracks by allowing the dimensions of the aperture to be measured without needing to be present to read on the spot, as seen in the methods currently used.

The Pap smear, regarded as the most successful cancer screening test in the history of medicine, has been in existence for over 70 years. However, due to the lack of Pap smear screening programs in developing countries or other social and economic barriers in developed countries, the rates of new cervical cancer cases and deaths remain high worldwide. To circumvent these challenges, we developed a molecular diagnostic test, coined the “Molecular Pap” based on HPV typing and unique genetic changes inside cells. The Molecular Pap was designed to be accurate, automated, low cost and compatible with self-collected samples from any bodily site. With the end user in mind, this project started with advanced molecular techniques, bioinformatics pipelines and probabilistic modeling, and will conclude with risk stratification and data visualization.

Given an audience who does not know about computational thinking and is not woven together by another common interest, my goal is to catch, and then retain, their interest so that they will learn computational thinking and the Wolfram Language for themselves. The design of the course includes flexible paths allowing participants to devote varying amounts of time to learning the Wolfram Language according to their interests and availability, and weekly sessions designed to be applicable for a wide range of audiences. I will discuss the structure of the course, focusing on my design of the special topics discussions, and show several example sessions.

These models cover situations when linear constitutive law (Darcy’s law) fails to hold due to the prevailing effect of turbulence for high Reynolds numbers or due to interaction between walls of media and liquid at the molecular level for very low Reynolds numbers.

In the talk, we will present several typical real-world situations, their formulations as initial-boundary value problems and their numerical solutions. We use implicit semi-discretization in time, which has much better stability than the explicit one, but requires the solving of strongly nonlinear elliptic problems at each step. To solve the elliptic problem, we will use several approaches based on finite differences, SparseArray and FindMinimum and/or new features of NDSolve in Version 12 using finite elements for nonlinear elliptic problems. The use of the implicit semi-discretization in time is justified by our recent findings obtained jointly with Benedikt, Kotrla and Takáč.

E-Architects’s philosophy is to design at the same level both foreground and background processes, displacing systems, parameters, computer codes and fabrication technologies to secure cultural innovation at a structural level, opening up new possibilities for new architectures. E-Architects expands design authorship, critiquing the division of labor (Fordism). This project challenges the background processes that usually remain separated from foreground object design. The e-Chaise Longue is 3D printed through a research, design and developed site-specific adaptable robotic 3D printer tensegrity. The uniqueness of this robotic 3D printer mechanism is that it is site-specific, therefore it does not depend on a structure to adapt to any existing condition. The e-Chaise Longue expands dimensions in the architecture of its differentiated field of points, lines, surfaces, volume and topology to displace the background process that informs its design. E-Chaise Longue’s digital design, 3D-printer fabrication system and material behaviorally feed back on each other, identifying latent opportunities to inform its design process. 3D scanning is used to start up in real time the e-Chaise design, which can be custom-fabricated to anybody. The G-code that controls the way the robotic 3D printer distributes the material is customized to address material behavior under stress. The e-Chaise can be materialized through industrially programmed polymer materials that sense and adapt to body temperature. The aim is to create a design that can only help in recognizing potential relationships between background and foreground design processes developing a continuously informed topological object space.

One of the experimental measurements of this elementary charge has been performed by Millikan. The elementary charge is calculated from the movement of charged oil droplets between the two plates of an inducer. By varying polarity of the voltage, we are able to the change direction of the electrical field and thus move oil droplets with nonzero charges in different directions. From their velocity in both settings, we are able to calculate the elementary charge. The motion is observed through a microscope. This experiment is interesting for the simple physics behind it, which makes it suitable for teaching purposes.

Using the primitives defined in  <i>Partitioning of Cellular Automata Rule Spaces</i> , published in 2015, we define the rule spaces and provide direction in navigating them, searching for class transitions. We find that the space has large regions of rules of the same class and there are particular transitions between those regions. We start this project with the elementary cellular automata and lay out the foundation to explore bigger spaces. According to the research, we found that the layout is based on partially ordered lattices, which may explain why these regions are not easily defined under other alternative orderings. Just as it is with phase transitions, traversing the space and trying to move from one class to another may circumvent regions depending on how you traverse the space.

Who has time to build an automated system to collect and process data, generate visualizations that give actual insights, create dashboards and then distribute or publish the results? You do! 

 Oftentimes, designing or working with these systems can be more difficult and time-consuming than deciding on the actual analysis. In this presentation, we’ll look at a case study of building a media monitoring and reporting system from the ground up, and that was purpose-built for use by an in-house public relations department in just a few hours.

"2019.Devendra.Kapadia.Asymptotic.Computation","Devendra Kapadia","Asymptotic Computation","The aim of asymptotic computation is to provide useful approximate formulas for expressions in the vicinity of a fixed point, such as zero or infinity. Stirling’s formula for factorials is an excellent example that illustrates the power and utility of asymptotic approximations. 

 In this talk, I will discuss the new Asymptotic and DiscreteAsymptotic functions, which can be used to compute asymptotic approximations for functions and sequences, integral and summation transforms, differential and difference equations,  integrals and sums, etc. These superfunctions will provide the next level of automation beyond functions such as AsymptoticDSolveValue and AsymptoticIntegrate, which were introduced in earlier versions, and will bring us closer to the goal of establishing asymptotic methods as a third mode of computing in the Wolfram Language.

The sensor data is sent over I2C by integrating the currents from an array consisting of red-filtered, green-filtered, blue-filtered and unfiltered photodiodes. The microcontroller obtains the I2C data and then sends it over serial to Mathematica. The I2C and serial communication techniques are general, and can be adapted for other I2C and serial devices. The various approaches are compared, and the talk also includes a potential application example.

In Version 12, we extended the feature into many 2D and 3D visualization functions. Labeling automation includes algorithms that find label locations with minimal conflicts, optimization problems for adjusting positions for chart and curve labels, and the resizing of non-textual labels to fit in the graphics for maximal display. In this talk, we will take a look at what we have worked on since last year.

The number remains prime when any sequence of leading digits is removed, down to 7. There are 4260 such primes. In base 24, there are 1'052'029'701 truncatable primes. 

 We discuss parallel search strategies for counting all primes in bases up to 100 and compare the results with predictions based on the prime number theorem for arithmetic progressions. For example, the calculation for base 30 is estimated to take about 750 CPU core years.

"2019.Peter.Jacobse.PhD.Graphene.Nanoribbons.and.the.Experimentalist","Peter Jacobse, PhD","Graphene Nanoribbons and the Experimentalist Who Used Mathematica","Scanning tunneling and atomic force microscopy are methods that have the power to resolve structures, materials and molecules down to the single atom and single bond. Additionally, they can provide insight into the electronic structure of materials.      The materials that I am interested in are graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). These strips of single-atom-thick carbon have a much more solid electronic performance than their flimsy nature seems to suggest: their conductance can outperform metals like copper and gold, and the electrons are so fast that they enable electronic components with unrivaled operating speeds. In contrast with their parent material graphene, GNRs feature a band gap, so that the material can be made to conduct at will. To understand the electronic structure of GNRs, I developed a Mathematica package with a set of functions that allowed me to perform quantum mechanical calculations at the level of (Hubbard) tight-binding. Recently, the package was published: an all-purpose tight-binding code featuring functionality that allows for a plethora of calculations to be carried out on a large variety of different structures. In this presentation I would like to show how MathemaTB has become my loyal “GNR electronic structure cruncher.” Its wide applicability means that it might be your loyal help in your tight-binding needs too.

"2019.Ruhi.Shah.A.Model.for.Quantum.Cellular","Ruhi Shah","A Model for Quantum Cellular Automata","A new model for quantum cellular automata (QCAs) is proposed. It evolves a tensor product of qubits using unitary operators that are arity-2 logic gates. The models currently available for QCAs are limited in the amount of rules one can apply. The models mentioned in this paper allow for an infinite number of possible rules, from which interesting behaviour can arise. It is found that all QCAs of this form reach an equilibrium state. It is found that the time taken to reach this state is independent of initial conditions. It is also found that certain QCAs show resonance. Another new model is also proposed, one based on the quantum teleportation protocol.

It will be relevant to a broad audience, and knowledge about taxonomy won’t be required. First, I will show how to import species data from external biodiversity databases. This data will contain taxonomic information, images and other information like distribution (spatial) data and ecological data of the species. Then I’ll make use of several frameworks, such as knowledge representation using entities; graphs and networks; and geographic data and computation. Finally, I will show how to use machine learning techniques to perform automated species identification (using both images and audios files).

"2019.Jay.Alan.Jackson.How.to.Train.Your.Robotic","Jay Alan Jackson","How to Train Your Robotic Sea Turtle/Close Encounters of the m-th Kind","This presentation will show how a combination of Mathematica, UnityLink and the Unity3D game engine helped to produce an interactive music video. It will examine a number of capabilities of the Wolfram Language useful in making a Unity project, e.g. to calculate positions and orientations along curves, fashion geometric objects, generate sounds, sequence events and map motion capture data to avatar control. The video features AIMSPP, an Artificially Intelligent Multi-sensory Signal and Pattern Perceiver embodied as a robotic sea turtle and six wild yet playful dolphins, nicknamed A Pod Calypso. The sci-fi storyline goes like this: A Pod Calypso has taken refuge within a desolated aquatic zone known as the Caribbean Trapezoid.  Scientists aboard  <i>Riff Raft</i> , an exploratory vessel from the Cetacean Intelligence and Communication Investigation Lab (CICIL), are seeking to make contact and carry out research, but this atypical tropical troupe of marine mammals remains elusive and cautiously distant. Observations from far away reveal A Pod Calypso likes to perform expressive and polyrhythmic body movements while emitting exotic percussive sounds in synchrony. Consequently, the CICIL squad now plans to carry out experiments deploying a purposely trained AIMSPP to conduct novel song-and-dance routines composed from myriad mixed messages of music, motion and math. The conjecture is that such actions may draw A Pod Calypso nearer, giving rise to close encounters of the  <i>m</i> th kind.

Over the years, project topics have included linguistics, video image analysis, Dynamic[] data collection, analysis and presentation, machine learning, and beyond. Most recently, we chose colorimetry and psychophysics as our project theme. Using the Device[] framework and an Arduino for data collection, we built a machine learning model from publicly available hyperspectral data that could reliably discriminate fruit types from simple, low-dimensional spectral scans.  The resulting project was well received by students and covered a broad range of topics that are useful in neuroscience, including procedural programming of the Arduino, basic electronics, sensor-based data acquisition, functional programming in the Wolfram Language, instrument calibration, analysis, visualization and machine learning. Here we discuss the various challenges and successes in this 15-week class.
