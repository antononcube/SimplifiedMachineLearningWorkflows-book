## What is this about?

Rapid specification of Machine Learning (ML) workflows using natural language commands.

The easiest things to automate with ML are ML workflows. 

This presentation demonstrates that with natural language interfaces to ML algorithms.


## Motivation

Assume that:

1. We want to create conversation agents that help Data Science (DS) and ML 
practitioners to quickly create first, initial versions of different DS and ML workflows 
for different programming languages and related packages. 

2. We expect that the initial versions of programming code are tweaked further.
(In order to produce desired outcomes in the application area of interest.)



## The workflows considered

In this presentation we focus on these three ML areas:

- Quantile Regression (QR)

- Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)

- Recommendations



## First example data

Assume we have a data frame with temperature data. 
Here is a summary:

```{r}
summary(dfTemperatureData)
```

```{r, qr-data, fig.width=16, fig.height=6}
ggplot2::ggplot(dfTemperatureData) + ggplot2::geom_point( ggplot2::aes( x = Time, y = Temperature ) )
```



## Quantile Regression worfklow: first example

Here is a Quantile Regression (QR) workflow specification:

```{r qr-basic-pipeline, warning=FALSE, fig.width=16, fig.height=6}
qrmon2 <- 
  eval( expr = to_QRMon_R_command( 
    "create from dfTemperatureData;
     compute quantile regression with 12 knots and probabilities 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75;
     show date list plot with date origin 1900-01-01;", parse = TRUE) )
```


## How it is done?

For a given ML domain (like QR or LSA) we create two types of Domain Specific Languages (DSL's):

1. a software monad (i.e. programming language pipeline package) and 

2. a DSL that is a subset of a spoken language.

These two DSL's are combined: the latter translates natural language commands into the former.

By executing those translations we interpret commands of spoken DSL's into ML computational results.

Note, that we assume that there is a separate system that converts speech into text.


## Development cycle

Here is a clarification diagram:

## Grammars and parsers

For each type of workflow is developed a specialized DSL translation [Raku](https://raku.org) module.

Each Raku module:

1. Has grammars for parsing a sequence of natural commands of a certain DSL

2. Translates the parsing results into corresponding software monad code

Different programming languages and packages can be the targets of the DSL translation.

(At this point are implemented DSL-translators to Python, R, and Wolfram Language.)

Here is an [example grammar](https://github.com/antononcube/ConversationalAgents/blob/master/Packages/Perl6/QuantileRegressionWorkflows/lib/QuantileRegressionWorkflows/Grammar.pm6). 


## Quantile Regression workflow: translation

Here is how a sequence of natural commands that specifies a QR workflow
is translated into code for a QR software monad:

```{r}
qrExpr <- 
  to_QRMon_R_command( 
    "create from dfTemperatureData;
     compute quantile regression with knots 12 and probabilities 0.05, 0.95;
     find outliers;", parse = FALSE )
qrExpr
```


## Quantile Regression workflow: evaluation

Here we evaluate the generated QR monad code:

```{r qr-outliers, fig.width=16, fig.height=6}
qrmon2 <- eval(expr = parse( text = paste(qrExpr)))
```

## Latent Semantic Analysis workflow: translation

Here is how a sequence of natural commands that specifies a LSA workflow
is translated into code for a LSA software monad:

```{r}
lsaExpr <- 
  to_LSAMon_R_command( 
    "create from textHamlet;
     make document term matrix with automatic stop words and without stemming;
     apply lsi functions global weight function idf, local term weight function none, normalizer function cosine;
     extract 12 topics using method SVD, max steps 120, and min number of documents per term 2;
     show thesaurus table for ghost and grave;", parse = FALSE  )
lsaExpr
```


## Latent Semantic Analysis workflow: evaluation

Here we execute the generated LSA monad code:

```{r}
lsamon2 <- eval(expr = parse( text = paste(lsaExpr)))
```


## Recommender workflow: data 

Consider the making of a recommender over the Titanic data:

```{r}
dfTitanic[sample(1:nrow(dfTitanic), 12), ]
```

```{r}
summary(as.data.frame(unclass(dfTitanic), stringsAsFactors = TRUE))
```

## Recommender workflow

Here are recommender workflow specification and evaluation results:

```{r}
smrmon2 <- 
  eval( expr = to_SMRMon_R_command( 
    "create from dfTitanic; 
     apply the LSI functions inverse document frequency, term frequency, and cosine;
     compute the top 6 recommendations for the profile female=1, 30=1; 
     extend recommendations with dfTitanic;
     show pipeline value", parse = TRUE ) )
```


## Handling misspellings

The approach taken in the design and implementation of the natural language commands interpreters 
can handle misspellings:

```{r}
smrmon2 <- 
  eval( expr = to_SMRMon_R_command( 
    "create from dfTitanic; 
     aply the LSI functions inverse document frequency, term frequency, and cosine;
     compute the top 6 recomendations for the profle female=1, 30=1; 
     extend recommendations with dfTitanic;
     show pipeline value" ) )
```

## Not just ML workflows

Obviously this approach can be used for any type of computational workflows.

Here is an example of an Epidemiology Modeling workflow:

```{r}
ecmCommands <- 
'create with the model susceptible exposed infected two hospitalized recovered;
 assign 100000 to the susceptible population;
 set infected normally symptomatic population to be 0;
 set infected severely symptomatic population to be 1;
 assign 0.56 to contact rate of infected normally symptomatic population;
 assign 0.58 to contact rate of infected severely symptomatic population;
 assign 0.1 to contact rate of the hospitalized population;
 simulate for 240 days;
 plot populations results;'
```

```{r}
to_ECMMon_R_command(ecmCommands, parse = TRUE)
```

```{r ecm-populations, fig.width=16, fig.height=6}
ecmmon2 <- eval( to_ECMMon_R_command(ecmCommands) )
```
