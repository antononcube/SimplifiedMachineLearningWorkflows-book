* Introduction
- This work plan is for the preparations for the presentation "Random
  Mandalas Deconstruction in Mathematica, Python, and R" (to be) given at [[https://www.meetup.com/Boston-useR/events/284045968/][Greater Boston useR Meetup on 2022-02-28]].
* DONE Work plan [100%] [14/14] 
** DONE Mandalas collection creation with Python [100%] [3/3]
- [X] Mathematica notebook
- [X] Rmd notebook
** DONE Software development [100%] [2/2]
*** DONE Python [33%] [1/3]
- [X] Implement opacity argument (~alpha~) for the Python package
  ~RandomMandala~
  - Without the mandalas being generated as fully opaque the
    conversion to arrays produces [dithering pattern] that makes
    the topic extraction from the mandala collections hard.
    - For both SVD and NNMF.
  - See [[https://pypi.org/project/RandomMandala/0.6.0/][~RandomMandala 0.6.0]].
  - See the related [[https://stackoverflow.com/q/71267653/14163984][StackOverlow discussion]].
- [C] Moore-Penrose inverse for sparse matrices
  - SciPy has ~pinv~ function for dense matrices but not a
    corresponding one for sparse matrices.
- [C] ICA method
*** CANCELED R [0%] [0/1]
- [C] ICA method
- [ ] Shiny app clone buttons for each example
