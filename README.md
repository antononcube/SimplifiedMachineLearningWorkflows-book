# "Simplified Machine Learning Workflows" book

This repository contains chapters, code, and organizational files for the book "Simplified Machine Learning Workflows".

***The book is not finished yet -- it is a work in progress...***

## Mission statement 

This book provides introductions, explanations, and demonstrations of different, frequently used Machine Learning (ML) workflows.
The ML workflows discussed are built through monadic programming packages, and those packages should be easy to utilize 
after reading this book.

## Programming languages

The programming languages used are 
[Wolfram Language (WL)](https://www.wolfram.com/language/) 
and 
[R](https://www.r-project.org).
 
All code is available in *both* WL and R. 

("Wolfram Language" and "Mathematica" are used as synonyms in this book.)

## Code and related repositories

All of the WL monad packages are published in
[MathematicaForPrediction at GitHub](https://github.com/antononcube/MathematicaForPrediction/tree/master/MonadicProgramming).

All of the R monad packages are published in
[R-packages at GitHub](https://github.com/antononcube/R-packages),
[QRTMon-R](https://github.com/antononcube/QRMon-R), and
[ERTMon-R](https://github.com/antononcube/ERTMon-R).

Most of the chapters are previously published in
[MathematicaForPrediction at GitHub](https://github.com/antononcube/MathematicaForPrediction).
