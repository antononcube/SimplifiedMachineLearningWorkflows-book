The intended audience for these tutorials includes the useR! 2020 attendees, coming from a variety of academic background and levels of preparation and usage level of R. Each tutorial session will be 3.5 hours long, with a 30-minute break dividing the session into roughly two equal halves (audience is welcome to take additional breaks as needed). The instructor is expected to have fluency in the topic of the tutorial and in teaching the topic to an audience coming from a diverse range of academic, professional, and other backgrounds. 
** DONE Audience
