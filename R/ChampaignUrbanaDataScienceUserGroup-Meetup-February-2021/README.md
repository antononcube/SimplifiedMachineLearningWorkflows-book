# "Anomalies, Breaks, and Outlier Detection in Time Series" for Champaign-Urbana Data Science User Group, 2021-02-05

This R-project has slides and related notebooks for 
[the presentation](https://www.meetup.com/CU-DSUG/events/jgrrbpyccdbhb/)
given at
[Champaign-Urbana Data Science User Group](https://www.meetup.com/CU-DSUG)
on 2021-02-5.

Here is a mind-map of the presentation:

I had to do a fair amount of R programming in order to prepare for the presentation. 
See 
[this detailed work-plan](./org/Work-plan.org).

There is a dedicated 
[Mathematica-vs-R project](https://github.com/antononcube/MathematicaVsR/tree/master/Projects/TimeSeriesAnomaliesBreaksAndOutliersDetection) 
that compares Mathematica and R over time series anomalies finding.
All programming and documentation for this presentation were made with having in mind the completion that project as an ultimate goal.
