#+TODO: TODO ONGOING MAYBE POSTPresentation | DONE CANCELED

* Introduction
- This work plan was for the presentation at Champaign-Urbana Data
  Science User Group on [2021-02-05 Fri].
  - Since I promised the organizers that the presentation is going to
    be at least 80% in R, the R-programming tasks are given priority.
- This work plan is copied and extended for the Mathematica-vs-R
  project :
  - [[https://github.com/antononcube/MathematicaVsR/tree/master/Projects/TimeSeriesAnomaliesBreaksAndOutliersDetection][Time series anomalies, breaks, and outliers detection]]
- A large number of the presentation elements and related programming
  were done for my Wolfram Technology Conference 2019 (WTC-2019) presentation.
- A lot of the programming and presentation topics center around:
  - Quantile Regression Monad (QRMon)
  - Geometric Nearest Neighbours (GNNMon)
- The Time Series Search Engine (TSSE) interfaces over COVID-19 data
  were made for in a previous project.
* DONE Programming [100%] [3/3]
** DONE Finding variance anomalies [50%] [1/2]
- ~QRMonFindVarianceAnomalies~
*** DONE In QRMon-R
*** POSTPresentation In QRMin-WL
** DONE Interactive interfaces [100%] [2/2]
*** DONE Shiny [66%] [2/3]
**** DONE ~QRMon~ for anomalies finding 
**** DONE ~GNNMon~ for anomalies finding
**** POSTPresentation Extend with BYOD
- Extend with Bring Your Own Data (BYOD) entry fields or panel.
*** DONE Mathematica [100%] [2/2]
**** DONE GNNMon for time series anomalies
**** DONE Multiple runs of ~QRMonFindAnomalies~
- That was implemented for WTC-2019, but had to be reviewed and made
  more presentable
  - (It was not used in the presentation.)
** DONE ROC functions package in R [100%] [6/6]
- [X] Make a dedicated package directory in R-packages
- [X] Program dictionary of ROC functions abbreviations to explanations
- [X] Program ROC functions application function
- [X] Document functions
- [X] Make tests
- [X] Test with the scaffolding examples in presentation project
* DONE Presentation [100%] [10/10]
** DONE Make a mind-map
- For quicker orientation.
** DONE Simplest method
- [X] Application of ~GNNMon~ over overlapping signal blocks
- [X] Program the method and flex-dashboard
- [X] Publish on ~shinyapps.io~
- [X] Same interface in Mathematica
  - Programmed it but did not show it in the presentation.
** DONE Scaffolding notebook and examples [100%] [4/4]
- [X] Generate random time series
  - Did in Mathematica in order to reuse ~QRMon~ based functions for
    introducing outliers.
- [X] Cartesian product of parameters for ~QRMonFindAnomaliesByResiduals~
- [X] Program ROC functions
  - Turned out that it was simpler to write an R package for ROC
    functions calculations.
    - Similar to the corresponding, much older, Mathematica package.
- [X] Make simple shiny interface for custom made formula
** DONE QRMon-R over Apple Maps data for Nice France [100%] [5/5]
- [X] Copy the general ~QRMon-R~ Shiny flex-dashboard
- [X] Extract the data for Nice, France from the Apple Mobility data
- [X] Export the data as part of the presentation's project
- [X] Change the flex-dashboard code
- [X] Verify and experiment with the dashboard (and data)
** DONE Prepare examples time series 
- [X] Numenta benchmark time series
- [X] National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) data
** DONE Find good examples from the COVID-19 time series search engines 
** DONE Make slides 
- I made a notebook, not a slideshow.
- The hardest part was making the plot that demos the 1D outlier identifiers.
** CANCELED Multi-dimensional examples
** CANCELED Code generation with natural language commands
** DONE References [100%] [4/4]
- [X] Shiny apps
- [X] WTC-2019 presentation
- [X] Links in the mind-map
- [X] Relevant, articles, packages, and posts
* TODO Documentation
** TODO GNNMon in R [50%] [1/2]
- [X] Review and enhance the original ~GNNMon~ examples document.
  - This was done long time time ago, but I reviewed the document.
- [ ] Document / describe the use of ~GNNMon~ to find anomalies in
  time series.
** POSTPresentation GNNMon in Mathematica [33%] [1/3]
- [X] Review the original ~GNNMon~ examples document
  - This document started long time time ago.
  - I considered publishing it at ~MathematicaForPrediction.wordpress.com~ before the presentation.
- [ ] Enhance the original ~GNNMon~ examples document
- [ ] Document / describe the use of ~GNNMon~ to find anomalies in
  time series.
- [ ] Make a ~GNNMon~ workflows flow chart.
** POSTPresentation Complete and publish a Mathematica-vs-R post
- A dedicated project was made long time ago.
- Full blown document with comparison examples is the goal.
- Of course, relevant links to packages and dashboards have to fully
  listed and described.
