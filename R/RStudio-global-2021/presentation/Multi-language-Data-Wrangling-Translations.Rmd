## What is this about?

Rapid specification of data wrangling workflows using natural language commands.

In this presentation we show and compare data wrangling examples in different programming languages using different packages. 

## Motivation

Here are our primary motivation points:

- Often we have to apply the same data transformation workflows within different
  programming languages and/or packages. 
  
- Although the high-level data transformation workflows are the same, it might be time consuming
  to express those workflows in the logic and syntax of concrete programming languages or packages.
  
- It would be nice to have software solutions that speed-up the processes for
  multi-language expression of data transformation workflows.

Further, assume that:

- We want to create conversation agents that help Data Science (DS) and ML 
practitioners to quickly create first, initial versions of different data wrangling workflows 
for different programming languages and related packages. 

- We expect that the initial versions of programming code are tweaked further.
(In order to produce desired outcomes in the application area of interest.)



## The workflows considered

In this presentation we focus on these three data wrangling packages:

- R-base

- R-tidyverse

- Python-pandas



## First example data

Assume we have a data frame with Titanic data. 
Here is a summary:

```{r}
summary(as.data.frame(unclass(dfTitanic), stringsAsFactors = T))
```


## Cross tabulataion: first example

Here is a cross tabulation specification:

```{r titanic-cross-tabulate-command}
lsCommands <- 'use data frame dfTitanic; 
filter with passengerAge greater or equal to 0; 
rename "passengerSex" and "passengerClass" as "sex" and "class";
cross tabulate sex and class'
```


```{r titanic-cross-tabulate-base}
res1 <- eval( expr = ToDataQueryWorkflowCode( command = lsCommands, parse = TRUE, target = "R-base") )
res1
```

```{r titanic-cross-tabulate-tidyverse}
res1 <- eval( expr = ToDataQueryWorkflowCode( command = lsCommands, parse = TRUE, target = "R-tidyverse") )
res1
```


## Translation to other programming languages

Here are examples of translations of data wrangling English DSL commands into different programming languages (and data transformation packages):

```{r translation-table-programming-command}
command <-
"use data frame dfStarwars;
keep the columns name, homeworld, mass & height;
arrange by mass, height, and name";
```


```{r translation-table-programming-languages, echo=FALSE}
dfRes <- 
  purrr::map_df( c( "Julia-DataFrames", "Python-pandas", "R-base", "WL"), function(nlang) {
    res <- 
      data.frame(
        "Language-package" = nlang,
        "Translated" = ToDataQueryWorkflowCode( command = command, target = nlang, parse = F),
        "tidyverse"  = ToDataQueryWorkflowCode( command = command, target = "tidyverse", parse = F),
        stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
    rbind(res, setNames(data.frame("---", " ", " "), names(res) ))
  })
dfRes %>% 
  kableExtra::kbl() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", font_size = 22, full_width = F, position = "left")
```


## Translation to other natural languages

Here are examples of translations of data wrangling English DSL commands into Bulgarian, Korean, and Spanish:

```{r translation-table-natural-languages-command}
command <-
"use data frame dfStarwars;
keep the columns name, homeworld, mass & height;
arrange by mass, height, and name";
```


```{r translation-table-natural-languages, echo=FALSE}
dfRes <- 
  purrr::map_df( c( "Bulgarian", "Korean", "Spanish"), function(nlang) {
    res <- 
      data.frame(
        "Language" = nlang,
        "Translated" = ToDataQueryWorkflowCode( command = command, target = nlang, parse = F),
        "English" = trimws( strsplit(command, ";")[[1]] ),
        stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
    rbind(res, setNames(data.frame("---", " ", " "), names(res) ))
  })
dfRes %>% 
  kableExtra::kbl() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", font_size = 22, full_width = F, position = "left")
```


## Not just data wrangling workflows

Obviously this approach can be used for any type of computational workflows.   
For more details and examples see the ***useR! 2020 Conference*** presentation [AA1, AA2]. 

Here is an example of an Epidemiology Modeling workflow:

```{r}
ecmCommands <- 
'create with the model susceptible exposed infected two hospitalized recovered;
 assign 100000 to the susceptible population;
 set infected normally symptomatic population to be 0;
 set infected severely symptomatic population to be 1;
 assign 0.56 to contact rate of infected normally symptomatic population;
 assign 0.58 to contact rate of infected severely symptomatic population;
 assign 0.1 to contact rate of the hospitalized population;
 simulate for 240 days;
 plot populations results;'
```

```{r}
ToEpidemiologyModelingWorkflowCode(ecmCommands, parse = TRUE)
```

```{r ecm-populations, fig.width=16, fig.height=6}
ecmmon2 <- eval( ToEpidemiologyModelingWorkflowCode(ecmCommands) )
```

## How it is done?

We two types of Domain Specific Languages (DSL's) for data wrangling:

1. a software package for data transformations and 

2. a data wrangling DSL that is a subset of a spoken language.

These two DSL's are combined: the natural language commands of the latter are translated into the former.

By executing those translations we interpret commands of spoken DSL's into data transformation computational results.

Note, that we assume that there is a separate system that converts speech into text.


## Development cycle

Here is a clarification diagram:

![MonadicMakingOfMLConversationalAgents](https://github.com/antononcube/ConversationalAgents/raw/master/ConceptualDiagrams/Monadic-making-of-ML-conversational-agents.jpg)


## Grammars and parsers

For each natural language is developed a specialized DSL translation [Raku](https://raku.org) module.

Each Raku module:

1. Has grammars for parsing a sequence of natural commands of a certain DSL

2. Translates the parsing results into corresponding programming code

Different programming languages and packages can be the targets of the DSL translation.

(At this point are implemented DSL-translators to Julia, Python, R, and Wolfram Language.)

Here is an [example grammar](https://github.com/antononcube/Raku-DSL-English-DataQueryWorkflows/blob/master/lib/DSL/English/DataQueryWorkflows/Grammar.rakumod). 

## The translation execution loop

In this notebook we use the following translation (parser-interpreter) execution loop:

![ExecutionLoopInRmdNotebook](https://github.com/antononcube/ConversationalAgents/raw/master/ConceptualDiagrams/DataQueryWorkflows-execution-in-Rmd-notebook.jpg)


## Filter, group, and summarize: translation

Here is how a sequence of natural commands that specifies a data transformation workflow
is translated into code for a "tidyverse":

```{r filter-group-summarize-parse}
qrExpr <- 
  ToDataQueryWorkflowCode( 
    "use dfStarwars;
     filter by birth_year greater than 27;
     select homeworld, mass and height;
     group by homeworld;
     summarize all with mean and median", target = "R-tidyverse" )
qrExpr
```

## Filter, group, and summarize: evaluation

Here we evaluate the generated data transformation code:

```{r filter-group-summarize-eval}
res2 <- eval(expr = parse( text = paste(qrExpr)))
res2
```

## More complicated workflow: translation

Here is how a sequence of natural commands that specifies a more complicated data transformation workflow
is translated into "tidyverse" code:

```{r}
cExpr <- 
  ToDataQueryWorkflowCode( "use data frame dfStarwars;
  keep the columns name, homeworld, mass & height;
  transform with bmi = `mass/height^2*10000`;
  filter rows by bmi >= 30 & height < 200;
  glimpse data;
  arrange by the variables mass & height descending", target = "tidyverse")
cExpr
```

##  More complicated workflow: evaluation

Here we execute the generated LSA monad code:

```{r}
eval(expr = cExpr)
```
## Joins

```{r}
command <- 
  'use dfStarwars;
  filter by species is "Human";
  select name, sex, homeworld;
  inner join with dfStarwarsVehicles on "name";'
```

```{r}
eval(ToDataQueryWorkflowCode(command = command, target = "R-base"))
obj
```

```{r}
eval(ToDataQueryWorkflowCode(command = command, target = "R-tidyverse"))
```

## Handling misspellings

The approach taken in the design and implementation of the natural language commands interpreters 
can handle misspellings:

```{r}
res4 <- 
  eval( expr = ToDataQueryWorkflowCode( 
    "use data frame starwars;
    keep the columns name, homeworld, mass & height;
    transfom with bmi = `mass/height^2*10000`;
    filter rows by bmi >= 30 & height < 200;
    summarize data;
    arange by the variables mass & height decending" ) )
```

## Evaluation in Python

Using `reticulate` we can see the results of translating the natural commands into Python's "pandas" library.

Get data in Python:

```{python}
import pandas
dfStarwars = pandas.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antononcube/R-packages/master/DataQueryWorkflowsTests/inst/extdata/dfStarwars.csv")
dfStarwarsVehicles = pandas.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antononcube/R-packages/master/DataQueryWorkflowsTests/inst/extdata/dfStarwarsVehicles.csv")
```

Load the translator library and translate commands:

```{python}
from ExternalParsersHookUp import ParseWorkflowSpecifications

command =  '''
use dfStarwars; 
filter by "species" is "Human"; 
select name, sex, homeworld; 
inner join with dfStarwarsVehicles on "name";
'''
res = ParseWorkflowSpecifications.ToDataQueryWorkflowCode( command = command, parse = True, globals = globals() )

print(res)
```

Show the evaluation result:

```{python}
obj
```
