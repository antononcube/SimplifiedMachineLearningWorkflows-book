# RStudio::global (2021)

This R project is with the RStudio::global (2021) 
[presentation](https://github.com/antononcube/SimplifiedMachineLearningWorkflows-book/tree/master/R/RStudio-global-2021/presentation)
that discusses data wrangling code generation with natural language commands.

## [Multi-language Data Wrangling Translations](https://github.com/antononcube/SimplifiedMachineLearningWorkflows-book/tree/master/R/RStudio-global-2021/presentation)

### Abstract

This presentation discusses how to facilitate the rapid specification of data wrangling programming code using natural language commands.

We want to do that because:

1. Often we have to apply the same data wrangling workflows within different programming languages and/or packages

2. It might be time consuming to express those workflows with the concrete language/package logic and syntax 

3. Natural language workflows are "universal"
  
We demonstrate data transformation code generation for different programming languages/packages.
We focus on these three: R-base, R-tidyverse, Python-pandas.

In addition to code generation examples we also outline the utilized software strategy and architecture and 
the unit testing procedures.
