## [Multi-language Data Wrangling Translations](https://github.com/antononcube/SimplifiedMachineLearningWorkflows-book/blob/master/R/DataScienceStudyGroup-SouthFL-Meetup-October-2020/presentation/Multi-language-Data-Wrangling-Translations.md)

### Abstract

This presentation discusses how to facilitate the rapid specification of data wrangling programming code using natural language commands.

We want to do that because:

1. Often we have to apply the same data wrangling workflows within different programming languages and/or packages

2. It might be time consuming to express those workflows with the concrete language/package logic and syntax 

3. Natural language workflows are "universal"
  
We demonstrate data transformation code generation for different programming languages/packages.
We focus on these three: R-base, R-tidyverse, Python-pandas.

In addition to code generation examples we also outline the utilized software strategy and architecture and 
the unit testing procedures.
